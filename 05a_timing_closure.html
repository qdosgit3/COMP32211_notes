<h2>Clock distribution <span style="color:red;font-size:24px">&star;</span></h2>

<p>
In practice clock arrival times at <i>all flip-flops</i> in a
synchronous domain have to be &lsquo;close enough&rsquo;
that every flip-flop is committed to any changes before any flip-flop
output changes are perceived.  This implies &lsquo;simultaneity&rsquo;
of clock arrival.  Any <i>difference</i> in arrival times is referred to as
  &lsquo;<b>clock skew</b>&rsquo; and there is significant effort
expended in minimising it.<br>
<span style="color:blue">Note that the absolute <i>latency</i> of
  clock distribution is not relevant: the clock is an ever-repeating
  waveform.  It is any <i>differences</i> in latency (skew) which can
  cause problems.</span>
</p>

<h3>Observations on clock distribution</h3>

<ul>
<li> Clocks have <b>high fan-out</b>
  <ul>
  <li> a clock may fan out to thousands of flip-flops
  </ul>

<li> Clock edges should be &lsquo;fast&rsquo;
  <ul>
  <li> Slow edge speeds increase the uncertainty in exactly when the
       transition &lsquo;happens&rsquo;
  </ul>

<li> Clock signals are repetitive
  <ul>
  <li> The latency of a clock reaching a flip-flop doesn't matter
  <li> They always arrive at regular intervals
  </ul>
</ul>

<img src="figures/clock_tree.png" alt="Clock tree" align="right" width=20%>

<p>
These properties mean that clock signals require (electrical)
buffering &hellip; but that's okay providing the skew is still kept
small.  Because the signal is distributed over an <i>area</i> of a
chip this usually is in the form of a <b>clock tree</b>.
</p>

<p>
The clock tree needs to be well balanced, taking into consideration:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Fan-out at each point</li>

<li>Buffer strength (electrical)</li>

<li>Wire lengths</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a big task for &lsquo;Place and Route&rsquo;: fortunately,
tools will help with this.
</p>

<center>
<img src="figures/H_tree.png" alt="Clock H-tree" width=35%>
</center>

<p>
The classic &lsquo;<b>H-tree</b>&rsquo; structure is one method of
trying to distribute a clock across a chip with minimal skew.  Note,
all paths are (notionally) the same length.
</p>

<center>
<div class="inset">

<h3>FPGA clock distribution</h3>

<p>
Modern FPGAs have a dedicated set of clock distribution networks built
onto the chip which deliver clock signals to all flip-flops with minimal
skew.  There are typically a small number (e.g. four) of these networks so
that a number of different clocks may be used.  These networks can only be
used for clocking flip-flops.
</p>

</div>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center>
<div class="inset">

<h3>Reset skew</h3>

<p>
Another signal with potentially very high fan-out is
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">reset</span>
Reset <i>activation</i> is not normally a timing problem because reset
will be present for some time.  The <i>removal</i> of reset can be a
problem though.  Imagine reset being removed in one part of a state
machine but not quite making it to another.  This could cause the
machine to enter an illegal state.  It is often necessary to
synchronise an otherwise asynchronous reset to prevent this.

<h2>Timing Closure <span style="color:red;font-size:24px">&star;</span></h2>

<p>
Timing closure is, basically, making the logic fit within the desired
clock period.
</p>

<p>
A HDL design first concentrates on the logic <i>functionality</i> of
the system.  Timing closure is the subsequent process of persuading the
synthesized logic to operate correctly within the desired clock period
under all circumstances.  (It can be a major phase of a real design!)
</p>

<h3>Simulation</h3>

<ul>
<li> Okay for a rough-cut

<li> May be difficult to simulate <b>critical path</b>
  <ul>
  <li> the &lsquo;longest&rsquo; (slowest!) path between registers
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Functional simulation can give <b>cycle accurate</b> speed
measurements but not, directly, the critical path.  If the simulation
is run on a back-annotated<sup>&dagger;</sup> netlist extracted from a
synthesized design then it can indicate whether a particular sequence
will fail at a particular clock speed.  This is a reasonable guide but
is not reliable unless either the critical path is known (and
exercised) or the simulation is exhaustive since it is probable that
not every switching path will be exercised.
</p>

<blockquote style="font-size:80%;">
<sup>&dagger;</sup>The behavioural description has been converted into
a &lsquo;gate&rsquo; model including estimated delays.
</blockquote>

<p>
Example: a ripple carry adder.  Simulation with random inputs is
unlikely to find the slowest case, when a carry propagates across the
whole width.

<h3>Static timing analysis (STA)</h3>

<ul>
<li> Take blocks of logic between synchronously clocked elements

<li> Time all possible switching paths in block

<li> Find the longest
</ul>
<br clear="right">


<div class="row">
  <div class="column">

  <h3>Advantage</h3>
  <ul>
  <li> Quick to perform
  </ul>

  </div>
  <div class="column">

  <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
  <ul>
  <li> Should give a <i>conservative</i> upper bound
  <li> Can be too pessimistic
  </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<h4>How fast does it go?</h4>

<p>
This can be difficult to determine, exactly.  It is set by the critical
path.  From a HDL source this requires at least technology mapping into
gates.  Accuracy requires knowledge of gate strengths, wire load and
layout detail.  However it is cost effective to estimate timing early
to check that the implementation strategy is feasible.  Even pre-layout
the tools usually give an estimate of the wire loads to yield a more
realistic result.
</p>

<h4>Static Timing Analysis (STA)</h4>

<p>
In this case &lsquo;static&rsquo; means independent of input state.
The delays through each combinatorial path can be summed and compared
with the design objective.  This reveals the critical path or the
&lsquo;<b>slack</b>&rsquo; in all logic paths.  In the latter case
&lsquo;<b>negative slack</b>&rsquo; will reveal where the logic is too
slow.
</p>

<!--
<center><font style="color:blue;font-size:30px">** Expand on 'slack';
    maybe add an inset? **</font></center>
-->

<p>
The great advantage of static analysis is its low computational
complexity.  The disadvantage is that the &lsquo;critical path&rsquo; may be a
false path, i.e. one whose switching sequence cannot occur in reality.
</p>

<p>
In general STA will identify anything which is significantly bad at
low cost.
</p>

<h4>Tolerances</h4>

<p>
Estimating the timing of synthesized logic is not a singular
operation.  At this point there is the need to take into consideration
the triumvirate PVT.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>P</b>rocess: manufacturing variations will result in
  transistors of different &lsquo;speeds&rsquo; from batch to batch.
  The design should tolerate any expected differences, which can be
  quite significant.  The extreme (tolerable) values are known as
  &ldquo;<b>process corners</b>&rdquo; and timing simulation should
  verify operation at all of these.</li>
<li><b>V</b>oltage: the supply to gates will vary from place to place
  &ndash; sometimes dynamically as other parts of the system switch.</li>
<li><b>T</b>emperature: may vary significantly during operation
  causing changes in gate propagation delay.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to these factors an allowance is needed for <b>clock
jitter</b>: fluctuations in the clock period over a short time.  This
can be caused by &lsquo;hunting&rsquo; from a PLL clock generator
(q.v.) for example.  There may be something like a 5%-10% allowance in
the period for this.
</p>

<p>
Finally a bit of extra time is typically allowed for uncertainty and
factors which might have been overlooked or misjudged.  Designers are
still fallible and it is as well to acknowledge that too!
</p>

<h4>Does it go fast enough?</h4>

<p style="color:blue">
No, of course it doesn't; where would the fun be in that? 
</p>

<p>
Seriously, what is &lsquo;fast enough&rsquo;? In many applications
there will be a real-time constraint to be met but exceeding it brings
no additional benefit.  In other applications (e.g. microprocessors)
any performance increase is to be seized.
</p>

<h4>How can the speed be improved?</h4>

<p>
How close are you to your target? If you're &lsquo;miles off&rsquo;
you need to restructure your architecture to increase parallelism.
This may be done by:
</p>

<ul>
<li> deeper pipelining &rArr; faster clock

<li> increase logic parallelism &rArr; do more within clock cycle

<li> evaluating several things at once &rArr; do more with slower clock

<li> multi-cycle operations &rArr; sometimes allow more than one period
</ul>

<p>
If close to target you might be able to identify and recode critical
modules.
</p>

<p>
Tools can also be instructed to optimise for certain criteria, such as
speed, power, area &hellip; Normally gains in one category are paid for in
others.
</p>

<h4>Technology</h4>

<p>
Many cells come in families with various drive strengths.  Increasing the drive
will speed up an output (and slow the input, and probably cost power).
</p>

<p>
It may be possible to use different cell families to improve performance. E.g.
</p>

<ul>
<li> High-speed &mdash; low threshold transistors switch faster but leak more

<li> Standard &mdash; a compromise design

<li> Low-leakage &mdash; high threshold transistors save power but switch slowly
</ul>

<h4>Post-layout &hellip;</h4>

<p>
The process may need repeating.  After the wiring is factored in things
(probably) have slowed down.  Buffers may be added which increase the
latency but speed up edges.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully this process converges on something acceptable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Optimise early</b> to avoid wasting effort on &lsquo;hopeless&rsquo;
designs.  Layout and extraction all take time and more accurate
modelling also takes longer.
