<h2>Initialisation</h2>

<p>
When a state-holding element is switched on it will settle into a
stable state.
</p>

<p>
It is not predictable what state this will be, so it is unknown.
</p>

<p>
Does this matter? In some cases it does, in others it doesn't.
</p>

<p>
Example: RISC-V registers
<ul>
<li>X1-X31 are undefined</li>
<li>PC is defined (to an arbitrary value: we use 00000000)</li>
<li>Privilege mode must be set to &lsquo;Machine&rsquo;
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I.e.  only the essential values are cleared
Rule of thumb:
<ul>
<li>Control registers should be initialised</li>
<li>Data registers probably don't need initialisation</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Undefined (&ldquo;unknown&rdquo;) values tend to propagate through logic.
</p>

<p>
This is usually a good thing as it acts as a warning that something is
wrong.  Learn to <u>exploit</u> them!
</p>

<h3>Reset signals</h3>

<p>
The question of whether to include a reset on a flip-flop has no simple answer.
</p>

<ul>

<li>The inclusion of reset logic imposes a small power/area penalty on
  a flip-flop.</li>

<li>The fan-out of the reset network is typically very large and consumes
some resources.</li>

<li>Failing to reset a flip-flop which needs to be defined can be
  catastrophic.</li>

</ul>

<img src="figures/divide_by_2.png" alt="Divide by two" align="right" width=20%>
<p>
Case: consider a clock divider flip-flop:
</p>

<p>
<i>As a circuit</i> this will function because it is in <i>some</i>
digital state and will toggle to the other when clocked.
</p>

<p>
In simulation it will start unknown and always remain that way.
</p>

<p>
In Verilog you could &lsquo;cure&rsquo; this anomaly with an
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New',
monospace;">initial</font>&rsquo;; but if that is accidentally done to
something where the phase matters then it's <b>doom</b> again.
</p>

<p>
In general:
<ul>
<li>data registers can tolerate starting undefined
<li>control registers should be reset
  <ul>
  <li>this would include &lsquo;validity&rsquo; indicators on data etc.
  </ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Some designers prefer to reset every flip-flop as a matter of routine.<br>
(There is a small additional cost in size and speed.)
</p>

<p>
You have to decide which approach works for you.
</p>

<h4>Memories</h4>

<p>
RAM does not have reset.  If you expect a RAM to contain some values
(typically zeroes) you will have to write these in actively.

<ul>
<li>This is easy in a RAM model with a
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">for</font>&rsquo;
 loop. 
<li>This is considerable effort in reality requiring an FSM &hellip; and time.
</ul>
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Resetting in ASICs</h3>

<p>
Some form of reset signal is <b>vital</b>, at least for a subset of
the flip-flops.  These are primarily those concerned with <b>control
state</b>.  Without a reset flip-flops will power-up in an unknown
state.
</p>

<p>
In a physical circuit it may be that (e.g.) an FSM will
&lsquo;naturally&rsquo; progress into a stable state (like an
&lsquo;idle&rsquo; state) and await legitimate input &mdash; and it
makes sense to design it this way.  However this will not help in
simulation and you do need to verify your designs!
</p>

<h3>Resetting in FPGAs</h3>

<p>
The state of an FPGA is downloaded when it is configured.  This means:
<ul>
<li>flip-flops will be initialised
<li>memory contents will be defined
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This means, for example:
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">initial</font>&rsquo;
will work and a register can be preset at t&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 
<li>a memory (on chip) can be initialised with
  &lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">$readmemh()</font>&rsquo;
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The second of these allows the creation of on-chip ROMs, useful (for example)
in bootstrapping a processor or providing look-up tables.
</p>

<p>
Note that these facilities are provided because of the particular FPGA
characteristics.  They would not be available on an ASIC.
</p>

<h3>The &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; state in simulators</h3>

<p>
Unknown/undefined states are a characteristic of digital simulation.
Verilog simulation is digital, with signals adopting states {&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">0</font>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">1</font>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">x</font>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">z</font>&rsquo;} and these have well-defined operations.  For example:
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
0&nbsp;&&&nbsp;x&nbsp;==&nbsp;0<br>
1&nbsp;&&&nbsp;x&nbsp;==&nbsp;x<br>
</p>

<p>
Digital (functional) simulation does not represent intermediate
states, transition (edge) speeds etc.
</p>

<p>
Not all simulators work this way.  <b>Circuit-level simulators</b>
represent the analogue voltages on the wires to give more accurate
estimates of the behaviour of the implementation.  These values are
(in principle) continuous, therefore always &lsquo;known&rsquo;,
therefore they have to be
<i>assumed</i> at start-up.
</p>

<p>
Unknown values will not appear.  However the assumed values may not be
those which occur in a real circuit and therefore should not be relied
on.
</p>

<p>
This is another good reason for running a functional simulation as
part of the design flow.
