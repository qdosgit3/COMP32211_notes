<h2>Limits to Moore's Law Some implications</h2>


<h4>
Design
</h4>

<p>
Producing devices is all very well but they need to do something
useful.  There is an increasing &lsquo;design gap&rsquo; between what
can be made and how it is designed.
Whilst CAD tools and synthesis make designers more productive much of
the transistor budget is devoted to repetitive structures such as
memories.  The expanding number of &lsquo;cores&rsquo; on processors is
an obvious symptom.
</p>

<h4>Physical</h4>

<p>
Within an order of magnitude, all atoms are about the same size which
is one angstrom (&#8491;) or 10<sup>-10</sup>&nbsp;m (or 0.1&nbsp;nm) in
radius.  A 3&nbsp;nm gate length is therefore about 15&nbsp;atomic
diameters across.  The dielectric thickness is already much less,
perhaps ~1&nbsp;nm so only a few atoms thick.
</p>

<p>
Clearly a single atom is a hard limit to anything physical.  However,
at least using CMOS technology, the material must also retain its
&lsquo;bulk&rsquo; properties.
</p>

<h4>Manufacturing</h4>

<p>
Chips are made using photolithography and the feature size (3&nbsp;nm
[2024]) is already much smaller than the wavelength of the light used
(193&nbsp;nm) which is towards the middle of the ultraviolet spectrum.
Using shorter wavelength light is increasingly difficult as optics is
hard &ndash; think about trying to make lenses for X-rays!
</p>

<p>
It is possible to achieve higher resolutions using electron or ion
beams; compare what is visible under a light and an electron
microscope.  However a beam needs to be <i>scanned</i> whereas optical
exposure can print over large areas.
</p>

<p>
Therefore making structures photolithographically is akin to printing
whereas using direct beams is more like handwriting.  It is clear
which technique is amenable for mass production!
</p>

<h4>Economics</h4>

<p>
As chips get smaller they get harder to make.  The machinery needs to
be more precise (so it gets more expensive) and there are more
manufacturing steps (which increase the cost).  The resulting products
still need to be cheap; if the cost rises more than the benefit then
shrinking becomes uneconomic.
</p>

<h4>Supply voltage reduction</h4>

<img src="figures/breakdown.png" alt="Dielectric breakdown &
	      overheating in a FET." align="right" width=20%>

<p>
For many years &lsquo;popular&rsquo; logic devices used a 5&#160;V
supply.  Two big problems as devices have shrunk:</p>

<ul>
<li> Power dissipation too great (esp.  CMOS V<sup>2</sup>)</li>
<li> Transistor dielectric breakdown</li>
</ul>

<p>
To combat these, <b></i>core</i><sup>&dagger;</sup> supply
voltages</b> have been gradually reduced, now to below 1&nbsp;V, a
trend which must continue.  This makes the transistor &lsquo;on&rsquo;
and &lsquo;off&rsquo; states closer together (probably increasing
&lsquo;off&rsquo; <b>leakage</b>) and <b>reduces the noise margins</b>
available so that electromagnetic interference or radiation can
produce upsets more easily.
</p>

<p>
At PCB level, where different parts are assembled (and electromagnetic
interference will be greater due to the larger &lsquo;aerials&rsquo;
(tracks)) the voltage reduction has been more conservative, having
largely reduced only to 3.3&nbsp;V (a.k.a.  &lsquo;3V3&rsquo;).  Of
course this necessitates level shifting at the chip's pads.
</p>


<blockquote style="font-size:80%;">
<sup>&dagger;</sup>At the logic core of the device.  <i>Pad</i>
voltages interfacing with the PCB are higher to provide better
electrical <i>noise immunity</i> and backward compatibility with
pre-existing devices.
</blockquote>


<h4>High-K dielectric</h4>

<p>
&lsquo;K&rsquo; is the &lsquo;dielectric constant&rsquo;, more
properly called the &lsquo;relative permittivity&rsquo;
(&epsilon;<sub>r</sub>).  It is a measure of the electric field strength in the
dielectric.  Replacing SiO<sub>2</sub> as a dielectric allows a
thicker separator (less leakage) yet greater capacitance (which is
what switches the FET).<br>
</p>

<p>
Materials containing elements such as hafnium or zirconium are typical.
</p>

<p>
For rough reference, window glass (SiO<sub>2</sub>) has a breakdown
dielectric strength around 10&nbsp;MV/m (10&nbsp;V/&mu;m).
</p>

<!--

<hr>

<h2>Variability</h2>

<p>
Maybe the biggest challenge to future devices is random variability in
the manufacturing processes.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Diffusing atoms act statistically:
<ul>
	<li> with large numbers there is a strong likelihood that the actual number will be close
to the mean
	<li> with small numbers statistical variations are proportionately larger
	<li> transistor properties are becoming less predictable &rArr; larger margins allowed
</ul>
</ul>

<center><img src="figures/variability_1.png" alt="Statistical variation
		  effects on diffusion."width=60%></center>

<ul>
<li> Etching of tracks (etc.) will experience similar edge roughness, thinning or bridging.
</ul>

<center><img src="figures/variability_2.png" alt="Manfacturing variations
effects on features."width=60%></center>


<h3>Reliability</h3>


<p>
Guaranteeing the reliability of future devices may be difficult.  One
future challenge is making reliable computing devices from less
reliable parts.  This type of engineering is common in certain
applications areas through the use of redundancy &ndash; for example a
commercial aeroplane may have two engines but can fly with only one,
engines being regarded as one of the less reliable components.  (They
also have multiple redundant instruments, hydraulics etc.)
</p>

<p>
Integrated circuits have been regarded as quite reliable (once the
manufacturing &lsquo;defects&rsquo; have been identified by testing
and those chips discarded).  The reliability of the tests is threatened
(do you want something which &lsquo;just passed&rsquo;?) as is the
production <b>yield</b>.
</p>

<p>
Two questions for the near future are &lsquo;where it is appropriate
to introduce redundancy?&rsquo; and &lsquo;how should it be
managed?&rsquo; It is easy to include more microprocessor systems in a
Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP), assuming that one or more may not
work, and the software to handle this may be straightforward ...  or
not.  Designing in redundancy at circuit level appears to be more
difficult although this could be transparent to the software layer if
achieved.
</p>

<p>
One place where redundancy has been used extensively is RAM,
especially on server systems.  Often error detection and correction
codes (e.g.  Hamming codes) are employed to increase the memory's
reliability.
</p>

<p>
Figures from studies of DRAM error rates vary widely.  Some of the
worst-case numbers suggest perhaps a one-bit &lsquo;drop&rsquo;
(fault) in a gigabyte of DRAM every two hours.  A typical cause is
cosmic radiation.  (Error rates on spacecraft are significantly
higher!) See &ldquo;ECC memory&rdquo; for more details.
</p>

<h4>
Smaller dice?
</h4>

<p>
One trend is that the typical physical size of silicon die is
shrinking &ndash; although capacity is still increasing.  This helps in
keeping an economic yield.

</p>

<p>
Current chips may have 10+ metal layers &hellip; but the logic is

<p>
Making a truly 3D chip is a really serious challenge &ndash; not least
in terms of power density.
</p>

<p>
Making a stack of 2D chips is easier, and still:
</p>

<ul>
<li> saves space from packaging view
<li> reduces chip interconnection wire length
</ul>


<p>Problem</p>

<ul>
<li> How to connect chips together?
</ul>

<h3>Some other manufacturing techniques</h3>

<h4>Strained silicon</h4>

<p>
A term you may come across.  Silicon is a semiconductor (you knew
that) and the electrons (or holes) can move through the crystal
lattice with a certain <i>mobility</i>.  Like any crystal structure it
has a characteristic atomic spacing.
</p>

<p>
<i>Straining</i> the silicon involves distorting the lattice
distances, which can improve the carrier mobility and thus the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transconductance">transconductance</a>.
In short, it makes a transistor of a given size &lsquo;faster&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
Straining may be achieved by overlaying the Si on a SeGe substrate
(which has a different spacing).  More recently, doping the source and
drain of PMOS transistors has been used to compress the channel
between then (refer to a cross-section of a MOSFET).  To stretch the
channel on NMOS FETs a silicon nitride (N<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>)
gate overlay is used.
</p>

<h4>Silicon on Insulator (SOI)</h4>

<p>
The parasitic capacitance of the &lsquo;bulk&rsquo; silicon acts to
slow down switching.  This can be reduced by insulating the active
silicon &mdash; various approaches may be used &mdash; a process
referred to as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_on_insulator">Silicon
  On Insulator</a> (SOI).  This can also help with <i>radiation
  hardening</i> which is important in some applications, such as
  spacecraft.

</p>

<h4>Interconnect</h4>

<p>
The &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; on-chip wiring has been aluminium which
is a good electrical conductor and is easy to etch.  More recently
this has been (largely?) superseded by copper which is a better
conductor; the conductance of wires is increasingly important as the
wires become ever thinner.  Copper is not as easy to work as
aluminium; instead of deposit/plasma etch the chip's surface (at that
stage) has a SiO<sub>2</sub> insulating layer which is patterned with
etched trenches.  Copper is deposited over all and then mechanically
polished away, leaving only the deposits in the protected trenches as
the wires.  The process is repeated for higher layers.
</p>


<hr>

<h3>More &lsquo;exotic&rsquo; FET structures</h3>

<p>
The threshold voltage is affected by the bulk silicon or
&lsquo;body&rsquo; voltage.  It is possible to bias the body to affect
the switching characteristics of the transistor.
This is known as the &lsquo;<b>body effect</b>&rsquo;.
</p>

<img src="figures/back_gate.png" alt="Back gate: cross section" width=50% align="right">

<p>
Explicit &lsquo;<b>back gates</b>&rsquo; have also been proposed:
these could be switched together with the &lsquo;front&rsquo; gate or,
perhaps more easily, used to bias the channel and alter the
transistor's threshold.<br clear=right>
</p>

<img src="figures/FinFET.png" alt="Architecture of a FinFET" width=30% align="right">

<img src="figures/x_sect.png" alt="Transistor gate cross-sections" width=40% align="left">

<p>
Rather than have a planar transistor it is possible to
&lsquo;surround&rsquo; the channel with the gate.  This is
considerably more complex to manufacture but gives better
electric field density in the channel, and hence more control.
</p>

<p>
The results are higher switching speed and lower subthreshold leakage.
</p>

<p>
Although there was a specific original meaning, such devices &ndash;
which come in a variety of configurations &ndash; tend to all be known
as &lsquo;<b>FinFETs</b>&rsquo;.<br clear=left>
</p>

<p>
These, and similar, structures are of great interest both for fast
switching and for leakage reduction.<br clear=right>

<!--<h4>Exotic structures</h4>-->
<!--
<p>
FinFETs and similar were mentioned in an earlier session.  It is likely
that physical structures which improve transistors' switching
characteristics will continue to be developed.  The objective is to
conduct better when &lsquo;on&rsquo; yet avoid leakage when
&lsquo;off&rsquo;.  See, for example, Intel's &lsquo;Tri-gate&rsquo;
transistors.
</p>

<p>
It is also likely that processes will allow more variety of different
doping levels (&lsquo;speeds&rsquo;) within the same chip.

<p>
As SoC feature sizes decrease, transistor gate <i>lengths</i>
decrease.  At the same time the operating voltage must decrease to
avoid breakdown of the materials.  This leads to transistors becoming
increasingly &lsquo;leaky&rsquo; when &lsquo;off&rsquo; with
deleterious effects on power wastage.<br>
To increase the change in channel conductivity when switching
the <b>electric field</b> can be <i>concentrated</i> by adding more
gate surface(s).
</p>

<p>
Foundries are developing transistor structures on top of &ndash; and
in some cases embedded in &ndash; the substrate.
</p>

<p>
&lsquo;FinFETs&rsquo; are one such structure although the term is used
informally for other designs.  
Another example is Intel's <i>tri-gate</i> transistor which features
multiple parallel channels with &lsquo;wrap-around&rsquo; gates.
Generically this can reach the (imaginatively named) Gate-All-Around
(GAA) where the channels are completely wrapped by the gate.  (In this
last form the <s>channels</s> &lsquo;nanowires&rsquo; may even be
vertically stacked.)
</p>

<p>
The various &lsquo;rules&rsquo; pertaining to transistor <i>widths</i>
still apply, but not now to a linear scaling: instead the <i>number</i>
of &lsquo;fins&rsquo; can be varied.
</p>


<center>
<div class="inset">

<h4>Ultra-low power applications</h4>

<p>
Very low power applications may have to work for years &ndash;
possibly the lifetime of the device &ndash; of a small button cell.
Alternatively they may need to run be <i>energy harvesting</i> from
the environment (for example picking up energy from vibrations).
</p>

<p>
These applications are often (very) low-performance so the dominant
energy dissipation mode may be static leakage.
</p>

<p>
A long-established low-power application is the wrist watch.  A
contemporary example is the new (remotely read) gas meters where a
single cell has to sustain 10+ years of operation.
</p>

<p>
The design philosophy of this type of device is somewhat different
from the typical, drive-for-more-performance- computing devices, but
equally valid.

<h2>Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)</h2>

<center><img src="figures/TSV.png" alt="Through silicon via 
			 cross-section."width=70%></center>

<p>
(For scale, a bond wire will be ~100&nbsp;&mu;m diameter: possibly thinner
although thicker for power.)
</p>

<h3>Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)</h3>

<ul>
<li> Wafer back-ground to thickness of (maybe) 50&nbsp;&mu;m
<li> &lsquo;Deep Reactive-Ion Etching&rsquo; used to cut near-vertical
  holes: maybe ~5-10&nbsp;&mu;m across
<li> Holes insulated (SiO<sub>2</sub>), then metal filled
<li> Resulting wires are &lsquo;big&rsquo; but not as big as bond wires
<li> Still require some substantial driver amplifiers
</ul>


<p>
TSVs with spacing as small as 10&nbsp;&mu;m have been demonstrated;
initially, practicality may increase this distance for production.<br>
For contrast, pad spacing for bond wires is limited to around 200&nbsp;&mu;m.
</p>

<p>
Allows interfacing such as &lsquo;Wide I/O&rsquo; to provide greater
off-chip bandwidth:
</p>

<ul>
<li> faster due to lower load</li>
<li> more wires so greater parallelism</li>
</ul>

<p>whilst occupying a smaller physical volume by <b>chip stacking</b>.</p>

<center><img src="figures/chip_stack.png" alt="Chips stacked through
					       TSVs."width=40%></center>
<!--
<p>
This may be particularly useful for memory connections.
</p>


<h4>Chip stacking</h4>


<h4 style="color:red">Stacked CMOS</h4>
-->
<!--
<p>
An obvious application is to increase the amount of RAM (i.e. SDRAM)
in a small space with limited interconnect capacitance.  A
&lsquo;classic&rsquo; example is
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Memory_Cube">Hybrid
Memory Cube</a> (HMC) which stacked multiple DRAM dice.  This has not
(yet) been an unmitigated commercial success although it serves to
illustrate an opportunity.  A similar (rival) technology is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory">High
  Bandwidth Memory</a> (HBM).
</p>

<p>
Another attractive proposition for chip stacking is
integrating <i>sensors</i> with the processing logic.  Using different
dice allows easier (cheaper) access to different manufacturing steps
whilst stacking reduces the size and power consumption of the final
device.  This is attractive for devices such as image sensors.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Interposers</h3>

<p>
Between a PCB layer and a direct chip stack,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interposer">interposers</a>
can form an intermediate commection medium.  There may be organic of
silicon substrates, perhaps using
&lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-chip">flip-chip</a>&rsquo;
mounting.  They provide similar (if lesser) benefits and drawbacks as
chip stacking &mdash; although the two may be combined.
