<h2>Variability</h2>

<p>
Maybe the biggest challenge to future devices is random variability in
the manufacturing processes.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Diffusing atoms act statistically:
<ul>
	<li> with large numbers there is a strong likelihood that the actual number will be close
to the mean
	<li> with small numbers statistical variations are proportionately larger
	<li> transistor properties are becoming less predictable &rArr; larger margins allowed
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Etching of tracks (etc.) will experience similar edge roughness, thinning or bridging.

<h3>Reliability</h3>


<p>
Guaranteeing the reliability of future devices may be difficult.  One
future challenge is making reliable computing devices from less
reliable parts.  This type of engineering is common in certain
applications areas through the use of redundancy &ndash; for example a
commercial aeroplane may have two engines but can fly with only one,
engines being regarded as one of the less reliable components.  (They
also have multiple redundant instruments, hydraulics etc.)
</p>

<p>
Integrated circuits have been regarded as quite reliable (once the
manufacturing &lsquo;defects&rsquo; have been identified by testing
and those chips discarded).  The reliability of the tests is threatened
(do you want something which &lsquo;just passed&rsquo;?) as is the
production <b>yield</b>.
</p>

<p>
Two questions for the near future are &lsquo;where it is appropriate
to introduce redundancy?&rsquo; and &lsquo;how should it be
managed?&rsquo; It is easy to include more microprocessor systems in a
Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP), assuming that one or more may not
work, and the software to handle this may be straightforward ...  or
not.  Designing in redundancy at circuit level appears to be more
difficult although this could be transparent to the software layer if
achieved.
</p>

<p>
One place where redundancy has been used extensively is RAM,
especially on server systems.  Often error detection and correction
codes (e.g.  Hamming codes) are employed to increase the memory's
reliability.
</p>

<p>
Figures from studies of DRAM error rates vary widely.  Some of the
worst-case numbers suggest perhaps a one-bit &lsquo;drop&rsquo;
(fault) in a gigabyte of DRAM every two hours.  A typical cause is
cosmic radiation.  (Error rates on spacecraft are significantly
higher!) See &ldquo;ECC memory&rdquo; for more details.
</p>

<h4>Smaller dice?</h4>

<p>
One trend is that the typical physical size of silicon die is
shrinking &ndash; although capacity is still increasing.  This helps in
keeping an economic yield.  A smaller die will, of course, still be
able to accommodate significant functionality.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, ever-larger systems are still made incorporating
ever-inreasing funcionality.
</p>

<h4>Yield</h4>

<p>
&ldquo;<b>Yield</b>&rdquo; is the term used for the proportion of
manufactured devices which are verified as functional.  In the most
part a single defect will render a chip useless.  As defects are
typically randomly scattered across a silicon wafer &ndash; and quality
control means they are <i>fairly</i> rare &ndash; the chance of one
killing a chip is (roughly) proportional to the chip's area.  This
means the yield is greater for smaller chips.
<p>

<blockquote>
Example: say there are 20 defects across 1000 chips (the chance of two
on one chip is small) the yield would be 98%.  If the chips are twice
the area the would be (500&nbsp;-&nbsp;20)&nbsp;/&nbsp;500&nbsp;=&nbsp;96%.
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>Sometimes</i> defective devices can still be put into service.
Memory chips may have &lsquo;spare&rsquo; rows of cells which can be
mapped into place post-manufacture, or rely
on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory">ECC</a>; some
(e.g.) multiprocessor devices may be operable with a (small)
proportion of broken subsystems.  However many SoCs need to be
defect-free and the yield<sup>&dagger;</sup> is very important,
</p>

<p>
Yield for a particular process typically improves after introduction
as the foundry gets more familiar with that process.
