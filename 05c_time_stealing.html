<h2>Time Stealing</h2>

<p align="center">(<b>Not</b> something obtained with a simple design flow.)</p>

<center>
<img src="figures/time_stealing.png" alt="Time stealing in a pipeline" width=70%>
</center>

<p>
This is a technique to get a bit more performance out of a pipeline
which is not perfectly balanced.
</p>


<center>
<div class="inset">

<p>
Reminder: a <b>balanced pipeline</b> is one where the the critical
paths of all pipeline stages are (more or less) the same.
</p>

</div>
</center>


<p>
In the first example the critical path is constraining the clock
period; the second stage will evaluate before the result is needed and
the result is delayed by 200&nbsp;ps at the register input.  This is
the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; type of circuit.
</p>

<p>
The second example deliberately introduces some skew into the clock to
one stage.  If clocked at 1&nbsp;GHz this would mean that there was a
100&nbsp;ps wait for this register but, because it was clocked
&lsquo;late&rsquo; the delay to the next register would be smaller
(only 100&nbsp;ps, not 200&nbsp;ps in the example).  The
clock <b>period</b> can now be reduced to 900&nbsp;ps and all the
constraints can still be met; the pipeline goes 11% faster.
</p>

<p>
This is not a trivial process however; there are difficulties:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Standard design flows will not do this.

<li> There needs to be a well-controlled delay in the clock
distribution tree, which is difficult to make reliable.

<li> There is a stricter hold-time bound on the &lsquo;lengthened&rsquo;
     stage; it must be guaranteed that no logic path will take less
     than 100&nbsp;ps or that data may be captured by the same (but
     delayed) clock edge which initiated it.
</ul>

<h4>Why?</h4>

<p>
<span style="color:blue">Why not &lsquo;simply&rsquo; repartition the logic stages to reduce
the worst critical path?</span><br>
Usually this approach would be a better solution &ndash; and less
stressful when persuading the logic to synthesize at the desired
speed.  However this is not always possible.  Usually this will be due
to the inclusion of some <b>macrocell</b> which cannot sensibly be
subdivided: a typical example of this would be a <b>memory</b> (SRAM)
block which has been synthesized by the ASIC foundry.
</p>

<h3>&ldquo;Time borrowing&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
Basically the same principle as time stealing but exploiting
transparent latches rather than edge-triggered flip-flops (see
&ldquo;Two-phase clocks&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>
Because a latch is transparent for some time it allows an
early-arriving result into the next stage before an edge-triggered
device would.  Thus any time spare in one stage will be exploited &ndash;
automatically &ndash; by the next stage.
</p>

<p>
[Don't get too concerned about the <i>names</i> of these techniques;
concentrate on the <i>principle</i>!]

<h3><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/711317">Wave pipelining</a></h3>

<p>
A &ldquo;wave pipeline&rdquo; is a pipeline <i>without latches</i> to
re-synchronise data elements; inputs change periodically and
&ldquo;waves&rdquo; of evaluation activity chase each other through
the logic separated <i>purely by the delays</i> in the logic paths.
</p>

<ul style="text-align:left">
<li> In principle a wave pipeline could be the fastest means of
implementing logic.</li>

<li> In practice it is very hard<sup>&dagger;</sup> to ensure that all
  parallel logic operations take &lsquo;exactly&rsquo; the same time;
  failure means that part of one data element may catch up with its
  predecessor, causing a failure.</li>
  <ul>
  <li> As the manufacturing variation of IC devices increases this
gets ever harder.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Wave pipelining is mentioned here to for completeness rather than as a
suggested technique.

<h2>Multi-cycle paths</h2>

<p>
It is sometimes expedient (and convenient) to allow logic more than
one clock period to settle.  This does not involve any
&lsquo;clever&rsquo; timing tricks; the clock runs as normal but the
imputs to the subsequent register may not stabilise in a single clock
period.
</p>

<p>
This may (occasionally) be sensible design but you need to <i>tell the
CAD tools</i>.  If the tools see a clocked register they will
endeavour to make the timing &lsquo;fit&rsquo; whereas you don't care
some of the time since there are two (or more!) clock periods allowed.
Complaints about &ldquo;negative slack&rdquo; need to be suppressed.
