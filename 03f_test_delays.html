<h2>&lsquo;Cosmetic&rsquo; delays</h2>

<p style="color:blue">
This may be a bit non-standard but can clarify reading waveforms.
</p>

<p>
In a simulation there is no need for time to pass for causality.
</p>

<p>
In the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; things take finite times to happen.

<p>The behavioural model above will work because:</p>

<ul>
<li> Non-blocking assignments happen simultaneously (regardless of
  written order)</li>
</ul>
<p>But</p>
<ul>
<li> This can be confusing to read from a trace.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Two timing effects are shown on the right-hand side of the figure:
</p>

<ul>
<li> The finite edge speed of the transitions.</li>
<li> The propagation delay of the circuits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both of these are governed by electrical effects in the final circuit
implementation which are unknown at this time.  Futhermore, in a
digital simulation, states switch instantaneously so there can be no
direct representation of edge speed.
</p>

<p>
However it is possible to represent delays within the circuit
artificially.  This can improve legibility of a waveform file by
delaying register changes until after the clock edge.
</p>

<p>
At its simplest:
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
always @ (posedge clk)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
always @ (posedge clk)<br>
&nbsp; begin
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
begin<br>
&nbsp; #2<br>
&nbsp; data_1 <= value;
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
data_1 <= #2 value;<br>
&nbsp; data_2 <= data_1;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
data_2 <= #2 data_1;<br>
&nbsp; end
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
end<br>
</p>

  <img src="figures/delay_time_1.png" alt="more legible traces"
     width=60%>

<p>This can make the values on the buses at the clock edge clearer.  A
delay which is a &lsquo;small fraction&rsquo; of the clock cycle
probably gives the clearest result.
</p>

<p>
<font style="color:red;">The left hand code/figure is a bit risky in
  that the delay occurs <i>before</i> the inputs are sampled.  It
  relies on <i>all</i> the delays &ndash; including all corresponding
  modules &ndash; using the same delay.</font><br>
<font style="color:green;">The right hand code/figure is a bit longer
  but is typically &lsquo;safer&rsquo;.  The inputs are <b>sampled</b>
  at the clock edge and the output change is scheduled in the
  future.</font><br>
</p>

<p>
Delays are not synthesizable; they will be ignored when the circuit is
built although the synthesizer may produce <i>warning</i>s to this effect.
</p>

<p>
Delays can also be used in combinatorial blocks if an <i>estimate</i>
of the performance of an assembly is available.
</p>

<img src="figures/memory_timing.png" alt="Memory timing model" align="left"
     width=30%>

<p>
Another use for delays is in providing a more realistic simulation
environment.  This has been done in the laboratory when the framestore
RAM is modelled.  There is a delay in providing read data based on the
manufacturer's (worst case) figures and the RAM output is undefined
until that time.  This time is greater than a clock period.  A naive
model could provide data as soon as it was requested; this could then
be used in the next clock cycle and everything would, apparently,
work.  However if this is attempted with the delay in place an
undefined value will be propagated which <i>should</i> be detected
further on in the simulation.
</p>

<p>
Unlike an unitialised flip-flop, this is a situation where the test
code can actively use unknown values to help find problems.
</p>

<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
always @ (data_valid)<br>
begin<br>
#1<br>
if (data_valid)<br>
&nbsp; fs_rdata <= {out_reg3, out_reg2, out_reg1, out_reg0};<br>
else<br>
&nbsp; fs_rdata <= 32'hxxxx;<br>
end<br>
</blockquote>

<h3 style="color:blue">Debugging aid</h3>

<p style="color:blue">
One problem which can occur in a design &ndash; especially when trying
to optimise-out clock cycles &ndash; is the accidental creation of a
&lsquo;combinatorial loop&rsquo;.  This is where logic signals form
a <i>cycle</i> where one changes another and so on leading back to the
first; the change propagates forever.  This forms what is called a
&lsquo;ring oscillator&rsquo;.
</p>

<p style="color:blue">
Ring oscillators can have (occasional) uses &mdash; although they are
usually best avoided.  In a real circuit there is a delay associated
with each gate so it does, in fact, oscillate, typically at a high
frequency.  In simulation there is typically no delay specified so it
oscillates at an <i>infinitely</i> high frequency.  Thus, no
(simulated) time passes and a simulation appears to (mysteriously)
stall.
</p>

<p style="color:blue">
If you suspect this, the (temporary) insertion of a small delay in any
of the signals will ususally reveal the problem.
