<h2>Test Coverage</h2>

<ul>
<li> How do you know what you have (haven't) tested?
<li> Wouldn't it be nice if there was CAD assistance?
</ul>

These days there are <b>test coverage tools</b> which assist with this task.
Test coverage may indicate such things as:

<ul>
<li> which lines of a HDL were executed at least once
<li> which decisions were taken during a simulation run
<li> which wires have adopted both possible digital states
<li> which states of an FSM have been visited
  <ul>
  <li> which transitions have been traversed
  </ul>
</ul>

May even tell you things you didn't care about

<ul>
<li> e.g.  missing &lsquo;default&rsquo; in a case with all cases specified explicitly
  <ul>
  <li> except, perhaps the &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; case!
  </ul>

Works on the &lsquo;better safe than sorry&rsquo; principle!

</ul>

<p>
Another possible visualisation of FSMs is a view of the state diagram.
This can reveal not only the states which have (not) been visited but
also which transitions have (not) been taken.  The latter duplicates
some of the &lsquo;block&rsquo; coverage in that, if all blocks have
been executed all possible transitions must have happened.  However it
does provide a (useful?) alternative view.
</p>

<p>
HDL test coverage is visited <u>practically</u> in phase&nbsp;2 of the
accompanying practical exercise.

<h2>Test coverage &lsquo;failures&rsquo;</h2>

<p>
There are some things which it cannot reveal:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Things you forgot to put in
<li> Scheduling issues
<li> Some consequences of intenal state (see example below)
<li> Implementation: the nodes which have toggled are bits as
  specified in the <i>source</i> language; it is likely that a
  gate-level implementation will introduce other wires not &lsquo;visible&rsquo; yet.
</ul>

<p>
Here is an example of an inadequate test applied to two different circuits.
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
// OR gate<br>
assign q = a || b;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
initial &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Test<br>
&nbsp; begin<br>
&nbsp; a = 0; b = 0;<br>
&nbsp; #100 b = 1;<br>
&nbsp; #100 a = 1;<br>
&nbsp; #100 b = 0;<br>
&nbsp; #100 a = 0;<br>
&nbsp; #100 $stop;<br>
&nbsp; end<br>
</p>
</blockquote>

  </div>

  <div class="column">

  <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
  // Transparent latch<br>
  always @ (a, b) if (!a) q = b;
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <img src="figures/inadequate_timing.png" alt="ambiguous output trace"
     width=60%>

  </div>
</div>

<p>
In either case all the statements have been executed and all the nodes
toggled.  &ldquo;100% test coverage&rdquo;; same
&lsquo;function&rsquo;; two different circuits.
