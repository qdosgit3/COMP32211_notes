<h1>Verification and Debugging</h1>

<p>
There are lots of potential sources of errors in a design.
</p>

<p>
This session ignores most of these and concentrates on functional test.
</p>

<center><p style="color:red;">First: <b>DESIGN</b> YOUR TESTS!!</p></center>

<ul>
<li> Does your device initialise/reset?
  <ul>
  <li> Is the initial state achieved?
  <li> Are there embarrassing &lsquo;unknown&rsquo;s in the circuit?
  </ul>
<li> Does it do the most straightforward operations?
<li> Have you tested every statement?
<li> Can you break it?
</ul>
<p>There are techniques to help with testing:</p>
<ul>
<li> Tools &ndash; but they will not find everything for you
<li> What didn't you think of?
<li> Don't throw a working test away &ndash; it will be needed again!
</ul>

<h2>Verification</h2>

<p>
The Reasons for Verification:
</p>

<p>
To establish that a design or implementation &lsquo;works&rsquo;
&hellip; in all imaginable cases.
</p>

<p>
The &lsquo;first cut&rsquo; of a new design will almost certainly have
some fairly gross errors.  Because they are so bad they cause
symptomatic faults very rapidly and so are easy to find.  It is fairly
normal to start with some crude tests and simply examine a short
output trace at this stage.  More complex, &lsquo;exceptional&rsquo;
cases may gradually be added and examined.
</p>

<p>
Later the design may be modified to fix esoteric faults or to
accommodate extra features.  Any changes will invalidate all earlier
test results so the tests will need to be repeated.  This
&lsquo;regression testing&rsquo; should be planned so that it is as
cheap as possible to perform.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to devise &lsquo;high-level&rsquo; tests which can
exercise every &lsquo;low-level&rsquo; component thoroughly.  [Imagine
picking a random, 3-input gate in a Pentium and wanting to write a
programme that used all eight input combinations.]  Therefore
deliberate testing and qualification of each unit in isolation is
essential if the whole system is to work under all design
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
As always the process needs to be both as <b>thorough</b> and
as <b>cheap</b> as possible.
</p>

<h3>Principle of Verification/Validation</h3>

<p>
Each &lsquo;layer&rsquo; in the design hierarchy should be tested
against its expected function.  It is not easy to test the lowest level
functions thoroughly in a fully integrated system.  Each layer of tests
should address how its components are put together; those components
should already have been verified.
</p>

<h4>&lsquo;V&rsquo; diagrams</h4>

<p>
V diagrams can be drawn in different levels of detail and with various
labels; the principle is to show that each level of the hierarchy of
the design should have an equivalent set of tests.
</p>

<p>
Progress moves left to right; time should move in a similar direction
although there may be iterations if problems are discovered.  The
(commercial) desire is to keep any backtracking as small as possible
to keep penalties low.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully this is familiar material! It is often quoted in relation to
software development but it is applicable to any hierarchical
engineering.

<h3>Jargon</h3>

<p>
Several words are used interchangeably for the test process.  It is not
possible to give hard-and-fast rules on these, but as a guide:
</p>

<ul>
<li> &ldquo;Verification&rdquo; is the process of determining that
  what is built is what was specified.  (What I meant to make.)
<li> &ldquo;Validation&rdquo; is the process of determining if the
  final system meets the requirements.  (What it should <i>really</i> do.)
<li> &ldquo;Testing&rdquo; can cover all the processes but is also
  used specifically for the post-production process of determining if
  a particular instance of the design is fault-free.
</ul>

<p>
(The first two of these are formalised by the IEEE w.r.t.  software.)
