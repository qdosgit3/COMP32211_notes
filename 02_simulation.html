<h1>Simulation</h1>

<p>
Simulation is part of modelling; the accuracy of the model is refined
as the design process progresses.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assume that high-level modelling has been done
  <ul>
    <li>Already know the architecture and the algorithms: models exist
    <li>Have block relationships but not exact (cycle accurate)
        implementation/timing
  </ul>
  <li>In this module simulation is refined to verify:
  <ul>
    <li>The functionality of an RTL description
    <li>The correctness of a completed chip
    <li>The timing and electrical properties of the proposed product
    <ul>
      <li>Thermal too?
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p style="color:blue">
Caveat: The intention of this material is to give enough information
to facilitate design.  It is not intended to be a complete description
of all the available facilities.

&ldquo;A little inaccuracy sometimes saves tons of explanation.&rdquo;<br>
Saki, <i>The Square Egg</i> (1924)
</p>


<p>
The purpose of simulation is to verify that, when you build something,
it will work.  First time and every time.  It is widely practised in
engineering when something expensive or potentially dangerous is being
built.  Examples include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Aerospace
<li>Architecture
<li>Bridges
<li>Nuclear engineering
<li>Silicon chips
<li>&hellip;
</ul>

<p>
Simulation is used at a number of levels from the design concept to
the electrical (and, often, thermal) properties of the final
product.  In practice this may not stop at the chip level as these
properties are also important in larger structures, up to complete
systems.
</p>

<p>
Simulation gives the ability to determine the properties of a proposed
system under a set of potential operating conditions.  Remember
&ndash; it only gives an approximation to &lsquo;reality&rsquo; within
the limits of the model used; this can still be very useful.
</p>

<p>
There is a trade-off between the accuracy of the model and the effort
required to produce it.  In our case this usually means that more
accurate simulation takes longer and requires more expensive computers
with more memory, file-store, etc.  Therefore there is usually a
pragmatic compromise on accuracy at various stages of development.

   <h3>&ldquo;Accuracy&rdquo; vs.  &ldquo;Precision&rdquo;</h3

   <p>
   Scientifically, &lsquo;accuracy&rsquo; is usually used to indicate how
   representative a value is to physical reality. &ldquo;Precision&rdquo;
   is how repeatable a measurement is.  If you measure something twice
   you may get different values; the question is how different?
   Repeated similar readings give a precise answer; however if the end
   was cut off the ruler they may not be very accurate!
   </p>
</div>

<h3>Observability</h3>

<p>
One big advantage of simulation is that the model gives
<i>observability</i>.  Consider building a chip, ignoring the time and
cost of manufacture for the moment.  If something is wrong then is it
possible to diagnose the fault from the outside?  This may be feasible
in a simple, combinatorial device this becomes difficult once there is
hidden state.  At the System-on-Chip (SoC) scale then this is
effectively impossible.
</p>

<p>
Simulated models allow otherwise hidden nodes to be examined so that
problems can be found much more easily.  Particular areas which are
suspect can be examined in fine detail.

<h3>Tips to make your life easier</h3>

<ul>
<li>Take the trouble to give <b>meaningful names</b> to units in a hierarchy;
    it makes identification <i>much</i> easier later.
<li>As far as possible, keep signal names the same as they traverse
    levels of a design; it avoids confusion.<br>
    These may be &lsquo;variations on a theme&rsquo; (such
    as <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',
    monospace;">xyzzy</span> becoming <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',
    monospace;">xyzzy_out</span> at a module boundary, for example)
    &ndash; it's just a means of improving legibility.
<li>Prefixes on related signal names can aid readability.  A bonus is
    that they will be grouped together in an (alphabetical) browser menu.
</ul>

<h2>Simulation detail</h2>

<p>
To finalise an ASIC design a number of different &lsquo;levels&rsquo; of
simulation must be performed.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Functional
<li>Timing
<li>Electrical
<li>Physical (maybe?)
</ul>

<p>
Each looks at different aspects of the design.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Require increasingly detailed models to perform
<ul>
<li>Simulations take longer to run
<li>Consequences of &lsquo;respin&rsquo; increasingly expensive
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
This section concentrates on functional verification.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the code (or schematics) perform the correct <b>logical</b>
  operations?
</ul>

<p>
The other aspects will be revisited later.
</p>

<h3>Functional tests</h3>

<p>
A high-level model (e.g. a TLM &ndash; <b>T</b>ransaction <b>L</b>evel
<b>M</b>odel) can demonstrate the feasibility of an architecture.  It
may be refined down to a <b>cycle-accurate</b> model &ndash; i.e.  one
in which each operation can be timed by counting clock cycles &ndash;
but not (sensibly) much further.
</p>

<p>
There is then a need for translation into a <b>behavioural model</b> which is
the function of a Hardware Description Language (HDL).  A behavioural
model may be just that &ndash; a model &ndash; or it may be a synthesizeable
Register Transfer Level (<b>RTL</b>) description which will eventually be
converted into hardware.
</p>

<p>
The translation process from TLM to RTL may be error-prone; there is
also the possibility of discovering previously untested cases as the
model is prepared in more detail.  There is therefore a need for
simulation tests at the behavioural level.  These tests perform
<b>functional verification</b>, i.e.  they check that the logic does what it
is intended to.
</p>

<p>
Functional tests do not guarantee that a resultant circuit will fulfil
its requirements: for example the design may be too slow to be clocked
sufficiently fast to meet real time requirements.  Neither do they
guarantee that the result will be constructable.
</p>

<h3>Timing verification</h3>

<p>
Functional tests typically use assumptions of synchronous behaviour
and do not give any absolute timing information; elapsed time is
measured in clock cycles.  The designer may have a target clock speed
in mind at this point; whether the design will achieve that is still
unknown.  Thus a design may do what it is intended to do but may not
meet real-time requirements.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to annotate the HDL description with timing estimates
to gain some idea of timing behaviour but these are necessarily
imprecise.  Circuit speed is greatly influenced by its physical
properties which are not yet known.
</p>

<p>
Timing verification involves estimating and summing the various delays
in an implementation to identify and isolate the <b>critical path</b>.
This can only be achieved once a design has been synthesized into the
target technology so that a netlist of gates, flip-flops etc.  is
available.
</p>

<p>
There are typically two phases to timing verification: pre- and
post-layout.  Having obtained a netlist, CAD tools can produce an
estimate of the critical path delay.  Modern tools are smart enough to
try to factor in wiring loads as well as gate delays; however the true
wiring delays are not yet known.  This will give a moderately accurate
guide to the maximum clock frequency.  If the circuit is apparently
too slow at this point it's &lsquo;back to the drawing board&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
Post-layout synthesis depends on a netlist following the
Place-And-Route (<b>PAR</b>) stage and has a better estimate of
timing.  As well as wiring delays, other factors such as the need to
add buffers (electrical amplification) may have been introduced.  The
simulation model used may be more precise, too.  All this means is
that it takes longer and, if a problem is found here, it is more
expensive to iterate the design again.
</p>

<p>
Another concern here are the &lsquo;edge speeds&rsquo; &ndash; the
time it takes to switch wires between digital states.  An edge which
is too slow harms circuit performance but is also more vulnerable to
electrical noise inducing extra switching.  Not all gates will have
the same input threshold so a slow edge may apparently switch at
different times when interpreted at different destinations.
</p>

<h3>Electrical characteristics</h3>

<p>
A real circuit needs power, something neglected up to this point.
When a gate switches its output there is a surge of charge onto or off
a power supply.  All these cause a (varying) current in the power
supplies.  There are (at least!) two serious concerns:
</p>

<p>
Are the wires big enough to handle the current? A too-small wire is a
fuse and will blow! More likely, there may be a wire that's a bit
thinner than is desirable which will &lsquo;age&rsquo; due to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromigration"><b>electromigration</b></a>
and shorten the lifetime of the device. 
</p>

<p>
The gate models assume a supply of a certain voltage.  The power
supplies carry current and have resistance, therefore will impose a
voltage drop (Ohm's law).  Thus the supply voltage at the centre of a
chip (furthest from the connections) will be lower than that at the
edges.  The power supply wiring must be adequate to keep this drop
within bounds for previous assumptions to remain valid.  In case of
difficulty, the usual solution is to force an increase in the
number/width of the supply wires.
</p>

<p>
Of course the power that goes in comes out as heat.  Thus there may be
<b>thermal modelling</b> ...  and so on ...
</p>
