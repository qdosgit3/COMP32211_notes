<h2>What to look for: Control</h2>

<ul>
<li> Start by stimulating simple sequences.
<li> Do the interfaces go through the appropriate phases?
<li> Are the FSMs behaving as expected? (Observe internal state)
<li> Have all the transitions in the state diagram been observed &hellip;
<li> &hellip; for all the reasons that might trigger them?
<li> Termination &mdash; does it?
<li> (test coverage &ndash; have you got it covered?
</ul>
<p> e.g.  a new processor processor fed with &lsquo;NOP&rsquo;s
  <ul>
  <li> resets and starts
  <li> performs fetch/decode/execute sequence
  <li> can stall if memory is slow
  <li> &hellip;
  </ul>


<h3>&lsquo;Families&rsquo; of tests</h3>

It is often convenient to divide tests into control and data tests.  The former
checks the sequencing and timing of operations so that the correct things happen
in the desired order.  In such tests data values may not be important.

The latter checks the data values are as expected.

These are not &lsquo;hard and fast&rsquo; divisions.  Examples:

<ul>
<li> Control may include a test for data stability even though the
     value is not checked
<li> Is the number of cycles performed &lsquo;control&rsquo; or
     &lsquo;data&rsquo;?
</ul>

<h4>Thinking up test cases</h4>

<p>
Consider an ALU in a pipelined processor design.  This performs a given set of
operations, typically one per clock cycle although pipeline stalls and flushes
may interfere with this.  May want to check:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Normal data flow through unit
<li> That the output retains data when stalled
<li> If the output is stalled, does the input stall?
  <ul>
  <li> This may be under local or remote (external) control.
  </ul>
<li> Is data validity passed through correctly?
<li> Is an attempt to stall the output ignored if the stage contains
     invalid data?
  <ul>
  <li> this would be an optimization for performance
  </ul>
<li> Does the unit ADD, SUB, AND, etc.?
  <ul>
  <li> signed, unsigned values, shifts &hellip;
  </ul>
<li> If an input is unused (e.g.  MOV &lsquo;second operand&rsquo;) is
     it genuinely ignored?
  <ul>
  <li> A use for &lsquo;don't care&rsquo; test values, perhaps?
  </ul>
<li> &hellip;
</ul>

<p>
Each test is simple in itself but they can be numerous, even in a
&lsquo;simple&rsquo; unit! It is likely that this list is not exhaustive.
</p>

<h3>Example: An interface between blocks</h3>

<p>
In the laboratory system the pixel output interface from the drawing
engine has the following timing rules.
</p>

<p>
There are two control signals
{<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">req</font>,
<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">ack</font>}
with an associated bundle of data.  Following an active clock edge:
</p>

<ul>
<li> if <font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">req</font>
 is not asserted,
 <font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">ack</font>
 should not be asserted.
<li> if <font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">req</font>
 is asserted,
 <font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">ack</font>
 <i>may</i> be asserted to indicate the acceptance of data.
<li> <font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">ack</font>
 will be asserted for a single clock cycle for each data item accepted.
</ul>

<center>
<img src="figures/interface_timing.png" alt="Interface timing" width=80%>
</center>

<p>
In the figure:
</p>

<ul>
<li> The first transfer goes through immediately.
<li> The second transfer has to wait for one cycle.
<li> The third and fourth transfers do not wait and follow each other
     as closely as possible &mdash; this takes two clock cycles
     because <font style="font-family: 'Courier New',
     monospace;">ack</font> must <u>pulse</u>.
</ul>

<p>
Notes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> This interface has been specified to be quite simple to use.
<li> Small delays have been incorporated into the figure for clarity.
<li> This is not a full &lsquo;handshake&rsquo; interface as data
  bursts can go through without separate request transitions.
</ul>

<p>
Do the tests cover all these cases?
</p>

<p>
Is (for example) the data held stable when the second transfer waits?
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What to look for: Data</h2>

<p>
Just because a design runs through appropriate control sequences this
doesn't mean that the output data is correct.
</p>

<p>
In an RTL abstraction the details of the &lsquo;data&rsquo; are not
really considered.  However it is important to check that the data are also correct.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Data values can be compared with independently generated test results
<li> Some data faults become readily apparent
  <ul>
  <li> out of range values
  <li> the wrong number of operations (cycles) are performed
  <li> &lsquo;silly&rsquo; graphics drawing &hellip; assuming the
       values can be viewed
  </ul>
<li> Self-testing may be possible
  <ul>
  <li> a processor can be tested by running some software
  <li> it will probably crash if there is an error in (e.g.)
       instruction decode
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
If control signals are interacting correctly the data can be
checked.  Probably the first thing to establish is that the data is
stable when it is expected to be.  It is not much use if a pipeline's
control signals stall correctly but the data tries to keep flowing.
</p>

<p>
The data can be sampled for correctness at the time an interacting
unit would do so.  This requires some expected results for comparison,
which could be generated in a HDL test harness or imported from
another model.  Note that the expected results should have been
verified in some way.
</p>

<p>
Data crossing interfaces should be deducible (if not directly available) in a
higher level model.  Such a model can be used in various ways to aid testing.
</p>

<ul>
<li> to generate stimuli for a HDL model
<li> to generate a file of expected test results
<li> as part of a cosimulation where it interacts with the HDL simulation
</ul>

<p>
A high-level model may also be able to generate internal variable sequences
with little extra effort.
</p>

<h4>Exhaustive tests</h4>

<p>
It is possible to test some units <i>exhaustively</i>, i.e.  try every
possible case.  These are usually combinatorial units as each bit of
buried state doubles the number of tests required.
</p>

</p>
Example: 8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8 multiplier block

<p>
There are 2<sup>(8+8)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;65536 possible input
combinations.  It is quite feasible to test this and it is possibly
the simplest thing to do.
</p>

<p>
Counterexample: 32&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;32 multiplier block
</p>

<p>
There are
2<sup>(32&nbsp;+&nbsp;32)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;18446744073709551616
possible input combinations.
</p>

<p>
Checking at one per nanosecond would still require over 500 years to
complete.
</p>

<p>
Exhaustive tests are feasible for control circuits, not for (most) data.
</p>

<h4>Representative samples</h4>

<p>
If exhaustive testing is impossible some sample data are needed.  There
are various ways of generating these:
</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li> hand generated
<li> algorithmically generated
<li> random
<li> biased random
<li> &hellip;
</ul>

<p>
Each method has merits and drawbacks.  Example: a set of random inputs
to a divider may be unlikely to test the &lsquo;divide by zero&rsquo;
case.  Random inputs could be biased so that (for example) small
numbers are more likely if a block which counts leading zeros is under
test.
</p>


<h3>Data timing</h3>

<p>
Timing checks require some more detail in the model.  Logic timings are
difficult to estimate at an early simulation stage; however there are
some timing checks which it may be worth modelling early.
</p>

<p>
A good example is reading a memory.  On the laboratory board there is
external SRAM to provide capacity for the frame buffer.  This SRAM has
an access time of 55&nbsp;ns &ndash; which is more than one clock period
(40&nbsp;ns).  A simple HDL RAM model might supply data as soon as the
address was valid.  In this case the data could be latched
(accidentally) after one cycle and appear to work.
</p>

<p>
Even more worryingly, the 55&nbsp;ns is a worst-case time; a real SRAM
device may meet the 40&nbsp;ns deadline &hellip; <i>under some
conditions</i>.  This could lead to many field failures, e.g.  when the
weather warms up or the battery is below half charge.
</p>

<p>
A more sophisticated model, which forces data &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; until the
relevant time has elapsed, would expose this fault because the
&lsquo;unknown&rsquo;s would be latched and propagated.
</p>


<h2>What to look for: Timing</h2>

<p>
Although it may not be <s>possible</s> practical to predict units'
timing relationships, even on a cycle-by-cycle basis, it may be useful
to monitor some sequence properties for verification.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li> Is the correct number of operations performed?
  <ul>
  <li> e.g.  when drawing is the number of pixels plotted correct?
  </ul>
<li> Is something happening?
  <ul>
  <li> Is a timeout detector appropriate?
  </ul>
<li> &hellip;
</ul>
