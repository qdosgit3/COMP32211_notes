<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_integrated_circuit">Three
dimensional structures</a></h2>

<p>
First ICs had <b>one</b> layer of metal interconnect.
</p>

<p>
Current chips may have 10+ metal layers &hellip; but the logic is
still, basically, <b>2D</b> on the silicon surface.
</p>

<p>
There are arguable exceptions e.g. DRAM &lsquo;trench&rsquo;

Making a truly 3D chip is a really serious challenge &ndash; not least
in terms of power density.

Making a stack of 2D chips is easier, and still:

<li> saves space from packaging view

<h3>Some other manufacturing techniques</h3>

<h4>Strained silicon</h4>

<p>
A term you may come across.  Silicon is a semiconductor (you knew
that) and the electrons (or holes) can move through the crystal
lattice with a certain <i>mobility</i>.  Like any crystal structure it
has a characteristic atomic spacing.
</p>

<p>
<i>Straining</i> the silicon involves distorting the lattice
distances, which can improve the carrier mobility and thus the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transconductance">transconductance</a>.
In short, it makes a transistor of a given size &lsquo;faster&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
Straining may be achieved by overlaying the Si on a SeGe substrate
(which has a different spacing).  More recently, doping the source and
drain of PMOS transistors has been used to compress the channel
between then (refer to a cross-section of a MOSFET).  To stretch the
channel on NMOS FETs a silicon nitride (N<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>)
gate overlay is used.
</p>

<h4>Silicon on Insulator (SOI)</h4>

<p>
The parasitic capacitance of the &lsquo;bulk&rsquo; silicon acts to
slow down switching.  This can be reduced by insulating the active
silicon &mdash; various approaches may be used &mdash; a process
referred to as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_on_insulator">Silicon
  On Insulator</a> (SOI).  This can also help with <i>radiation
  hardening</i> which is important in some applications, such as
  spacecraft.

</p>

<h4>Interconnect</h4>

<p>
The &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; on-chip wiring has been aluminium which
is a good electrical conductor and is easy to etch.  More recently
this has been (largely?) superseded by copper which is a better
conductor; the conductance of wires is increasingly important as the
wires become ever thinner.  Copper is not as easy to work as
aluminium; instead of deposit/plasma etch the chip's surface (at that
stage) has a SiO<sub>2</sub> insulating layer which is patterned with
etched trenches.  Copper is deposited over all and then mechanically
polished away, leaving only the deposits in the protected trenches as
the wires.  The process is repeated for higher layers.
</p>


<hr>

<h3>More &lsquo;exotic&rsquo; FET structures</h3>

<p>
The threshold voltage is affected by the bulk silicon or
&lsquo;body&rsquo; voltage.  It is possible to bias the body to affect
the switching characteristics of the transistor.
This is known as the &lsquo;<b>body effect</b>&rsquo;.
</p>

<img src="figures/back_gate.png" alt="Back gate: cross section" width=50% align="right">

<p>
Explicit &lsquo;<b>back gates</b>&rsquo; have also been proposed:
these could be switched together with the &lsquo;front&rsquo; gate or,
perhaps more easily, used to bias the channel and alter the
transistor's threshold.<br clear=right>
</p>

<img src="figures/FinFET.png" alt="Architecture of a FinFET" width=30% align="right">

<img src="figures/x_sect.png" alt="Transistor gate cross-sections" width=40% align="left">

<p>
Rather than have a planar transistor it is possible to
&lsquo;surround&rsquo; the channel with the gate.  This is
considerably more complex to manufacture but gives better
electric field density in the channel, and hence more control.
</p>

<p>
The results are higher switching speed and lower subthreshold leakage.
</p>

<p>
Although there was a specific original meaning, such devices &ndash;
which come in a variety of configurations &ndash; tend to all be known
as &lsquo;<b>FinFETs</b>&rsquo;.<br clear=left>
</p>

<p>
These, and similar, structures are of great interest both for fast
switching and for leakage reduction.<br clear=right>

    one</a> &ndash; [2024] (16&nbsp;mins.) &ndash; which is a bit newer.<br clear="left"></p>

<!--<h4>Exotic structures</h4>-->

<p>
FinFETs and similar were mentioned in an earlier session.  It is likely
that physical structures which improve transistors' switching
characteristics will continue to be developed.  The objective is to
conduct better when &lsquo;on&rsquo; yet avoid leakage when
&lsquo;off&rsquo;.  See, for example, Intel's &lsquo;Tri-gate&rsquo;
transistors.
</p>

<p>
It is also likely that processes will allow more variety of different
doping levels (&lsquo;speeds&rsquo;) within the same chip.

<h4>Multigate devices</h4>

<p>
As SoC feature sizes decrease, transistor gate <i>lengths</i>
decrease.  At the same time the operating voltage must decrease to
avoid breakdown of the materials.  This leads to transistors becoming
increasingly &lsquo;leaky&rsquo; when &lsquo;off&rsquo; with
deleterious effects on power wastage.<br>
To increase the change in channel conductivity when switching
the <b>electric field</b> can be <i>concentrated</i> by adding more
gate surface(s).
</p>

<p>
Foundries are developing transistor structures on top of &ndash; and
in some cases embedded in &ndash; the substrate.
</p>

<p>
&lsquo;FinFETs&rsquo; are one such structure although the term is used
informally for other designs.  
Another example is Intel's <i>tri-gate</i> transistor which features
multiple parallel channels with &lsquo;wrap-around&rsquo; gates.
Generically this can reach the (imaginatively named) Gate-All-Around
(GAA) where the channels are completely wrapped by the gate.  (In this
last form the <s>channels</s> &lsquo;nanowires&rsquo; may even be
vertically stacked.)
</p>

<p>
The various &lsquo;rules&rsquo; pertaining to transistor <i>widths</i>
still apply, but not now to a linear scaling: instead the <i>number</i>
of &lsquo;fins&rsquo; can be varied.
</p>

<h4>Ultra-low power applications</h4>

<p>
Very low power applications may have to work for years &ndash;
possibly the lifetime of the device &ndash; of a small button cell.
Alternatively they may need to run be <i>energy harvesting</i> from
the environment (for example picking up energy from vibrations).
</p>

<p>
These applications are often (very) low-performance so the dominant
energy dissipation mode may be static leakage.
</p>

<p>
A long-established low-power application is the wrist watch.  A
contemporary example is the new (remotely read) gas meters where a
single cell has to sustain 10+ years of operation.
</p>

<p>
The design philosophy of this type of device is somewhat different
from the typical, drive-for-more-performance- computing devices, but
equally valid.

<h2>Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)</h2>

<center><img src="figures/TSV.png" alt="Through silicon via 
			 cross-section."width=70%></center>

<p>
(For scale, a bond wire will be ~100&nbsp;&mu;m diameter: possibly thinner
although thicker for power.)
</p>

<h3>Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)</h3>

<ul>
<li> Wafer back-ground to thickness of (maybe) 50&nbsp;&mu;m
<li> &lsquo;Deep Reactive-Ion Etching&rsquo; used to cut near-vertical
  holes: maybe ~5-10&nbsp;&mu;m across
<li> Holes insulated (SiO<sub>2</sub>), then metal filled
<li> Resulting wires are &lsquo;big&rsquo; but not as big as bond wires
<li> Still require some substantial driver amplifiers
</ul>


<p>
TSVs with spacing as small as 10&nbsp;&mu;m have been demonstrated;
initially, practicality may increase this distance for production.<br>
For contrast, pad spacing for bond wires is limited to around 200&nbsp;&mu;m.
</p>

<p>
Allows interfacing such as &lsquo;Wide I/O&rsquo; to provide greater
off-chip bandwidth:
</p>

<ul>
<li> faster due to lower load</li>
<li> more wires so greater parallelism</li>
</ul>

<p>whilst occupying a smaller physical volume by <b>chip stacking</b>.</p>

<center><img src="figures/chip_stack.png" alt="Chips stacked through
					       TSVs."width=40%></center>
<!--
<p>
This may be particularly useful for memory connections.
</p>


<h4>Chip stacking</h4>


<h4 style="color:red">Stacked CMOS</h4>
-->

<p>
An obvious application is to increase the amount of RAM (i.e. SDRAM)
in a small space with limited interconnect capacitance.  A
&lsquo;classic&rsquo; example is
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Memory_Cube">Hybrid
Memory Cube</a> (HMC) which stacked multiple DRAM dice.  This has not
(yet) been an unmitigated commercial success although it serves to
illustrate an opportunity.  A similar (rival) technology is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory">High
  Bandwidth Memory</a> (HBM).
</p>

<p>
Another attractive proposition for chip stacking is
integrating <i>sensors</i> with the processing logic.  Using different
dice allows easier (cheaper) access to different manufacturing steps
whilst stacking reduces the size and power consumption of the final
device.  This is attractive for devices such as image sensors.
</p>

<h3>Interposers</h3>

<p>
Between a PCB layer and a direct chip stack,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interposer">interposers</a>
can form an intermediate commection medium.  There may be organic of
silicon substrates, perhaps using
&lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-chip">flip-chip</a>&rsquo;
mounting.  They provide similar (if lesser) benefits and drawbacks as
chip stacking &mdash; although the two may be combined.

<h2>Future SoCs</h2>

<ul>
<li> Future SoCs are likely to contain many processors
<ul>
  <li> Some explicitly will be &lsquo;multiprocessor&rsquo; chips</li>
  <li> Processors too useful not to be used for flexibility
 	(testing, redundancy ...)</li>
</ul>

<li> Likely to comprise multiple regions using different clocks, power
  supplies etc.
<ul>
	<li> Regions may be asynchronous; communication may be
	  asynchronous rather like computer networks now
	<li> Some (most?) regions may be powered off much of the time
</ul>

<li> Reconfigurable hardware likely
<ul>
	<li> Big FPGAs already contain &lsquo;hard&rsquo; processors
	(e.g.  see Xilinx
 &lsquo;<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/soc/zynq-7000.html">Zynq</a>&rsquo;)
	<li> Dynamically reconfigurable accelerators will allow (parts
	  of) &lsquo;software&rsquo; algorithms to be executed in
	  hardware (faster and lower power)
	<li> Distinction of &lsquo;software&rsquo; and
	&lsquo;hardware&rsquo; may be more blurred
