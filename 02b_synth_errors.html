<h1>Synthesis errors</h1>

<p>
There are different classes of &lsquo;errors&rsquo; which can occur
when synthesizing circuits.  These will typically have names like:

<h2>Error</h2>

<p>
An error is something which is definitely wrong and will cause the
synthesis to fail.  Things like syntax errors fall into this category,
as may some other problems.
</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>
Warnings are <i>probable</i> indicators of faults, or at least
infelicities!  They do not prevent synthesis but ought to be checked
and taken ito account.  A typical example is a statement which looks
as if it was intended to be combinatorial but has some unspecified
condition(s), thus needing a (typically unclocked) state-holding
element.  This may be deliberate &ndash; but usually isn't.
</p>

<p>
Toolflows will allow warnings to be suppressed (by category) which can
sometimes be appropriate but <i>they should be checked</i>.<br>
Another class of warning is generated when the circuit (apparently)
has no I/O connections.  You may see this in the later labs; it has
been suppressed there.
</p>

<h2>Info(rmation)</h2>

<p>
These are the least critical synthesis &lsquo;issues&rsquo;.
Typically they are more like <i>advice</i> on how a design might be
respecified, perhaps to be more efficient.  They <i>can</i> safely be
ignored although a good designer might be even better if they aren't.
