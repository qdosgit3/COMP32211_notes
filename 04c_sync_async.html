<h2>Think sync!</h2>

<p>
There are very good reasons for keeping to a synchronous style when
constructing an electronic design:
</p>

<ul>
<li> It simplifies the design task
  <ul>
  <li> Time is quantised
  <li> Given a state and inputs the next state can be determined unambiguously
  <li> Logical hazards (glitches during switching) are irrelevant (in general)
  </ul>
<li> Current toolchains are optimised for synchronous circuits
  <ul>
  <li> It's easy to specify synchronous circuits in HDLs
  <li> Timing analysis and optimization is designed to fit into clock
  periods
  </ul>
<li> Implementation technology is designed with synchronous circuits in mind
  <ul>
  <li> ASIC libraries primarily support D-type flip-flops
  <li> FPGAs contain many built-in D-type flip-flops
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Synchronous design</h3>

<p>
By this stage you should be used to the concept (and advantages) of
synchronous design.  The most important aspect is that the logic
functions can be designed statically; glitches as logic switches don't
matter as they can't pass the registers.  A clock happens only when
everything has settled and everything changes &lsquo;at once&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
A HDL (like Verilog) makes this easy; simply ensure that all state
changes use the same clock (and, preferably, the same edge).
</p>

<h4>Example: sample a counter every second cycle.</h4>

<h4>Bad Idea</h4>

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
always @ (posedge clk) &nbsp;clk2 <= !clk2;<br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
always @ (posedge clk) &nbsp;a <= a + 1;<br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
always @ (posedge clk2) b <= a;<br>
</p>

<p>
The timing relationship between the clocks is poorly defined.
</p>

<p>
Behaviour depends on a <b>race</b> between
<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">a</font> and
<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">clk2</font>.
<br  clear="right">
</p>

<img src="figures/div_2_sync.png" alt="Sync. clocking" width=30% align="right">

<h4>Good idea:</h4>

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
always @ (posedge clk) en <= !en;<br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
always @ (posedge clk) a <= a + 1;<br>
</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
always @ (posedge clk) if (en) b <= a;<br>
</p>

<p>
Changes happen simultaneously.  The
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">en</font>&rsquo;
signal controls whether a change will happen or not.
</p>

<p>
Toolchains are geared towards this style of design so they are capable
of ensuring that the flip-flops change (near enough to)
simultaneously.
</p>


<h3>Asynchronous design</h3>

<p>
It is possible to produce
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_circuit">sequential
circuits without clocks</a>; indeed much work has been done on this in
this Department! There are some potential advantages to asynchronous
designs.
</p>

<ul>
<li> No &lsquo;timing closure&rsquo; worries &ndash; except real-time
  applications

<li> Inherent &lsquo;clock gating&rsquo; saving power when there is no
  work to do

<li> Self-adaptive to conditions, e.g.  for Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS)

<li> Spread-spectrum switching reduces emitted electromagnetic noise.
</ul>

<p>
However the disadvantages largely outweigh these.
(If you didn't follow any of those points, don't worry about them.)
</p>

<p>
An asynchronous FSM can be constructed from RS flip-flops.  (An RS
flip-flop is a simple asynchronous FSM!) An input change may then
cause one or more flip-flops to change state, which may cause others
to change state, and so on until the system restabilises.  Care must
be taken to ensure no signal can glitch and cause an erroneous state
to occur whilst the logic is in transition.
</p>

<p>
There are some parts of a system where asynchronous signals are
unavoidable.  External inputs fall into this category.  However the
usual strategy is to synchronise these to the internal clock as soon
as possible.
</p>

<h3>Globally Asynchronous, Locally Synchronous (GALS)</h3>

<img src="figures/GALS.png" alt="GALS network" width=35% align="right">

<p>
This is a compromise solution which facilitates the production of SoC
blocks using conventional CAD tools and processes but bypasses the
need for global synchronous clock distribution (which is challenging)
and verification (which is also difficult).  As the scope of chips
gets larger it becomes convenient to restrict synchronous operation to
particular assemblies and worry less about the differences in clocks
between them.  However the each assembly can be synchronous internally
and this is usually a good plan.  A little more on this topic is
covered under &lsquo;interconnection&rsquo; where clock-domain
crossing is considered.
</p>

<p>
An advantage of a GALS device is that the clock rate of different
blocks can be different.  Clocks can be slowed &ndash; or stopped
&ndash; to save power; inactive blocks may even be
&lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_silicon">turned
off&rsquo;</a> for this reason.
