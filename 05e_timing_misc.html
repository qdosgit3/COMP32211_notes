<h1>Miscellany</h1>

<p align="center">
A collection of other timing-related issues.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Timing checking tools</h2>

<p>
A number of tools exist to assist with timing closure.  Many of these
are only appropriate when a physical realisation of the chip is
available.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Static Timing Analysis (STA)

<li> Edge speed analysis

<li> Hold time checking

<li> Clock skew analysis

<li> &hellip;
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_timing_analysis"><b>Static
Timing Analyser</b></a> (introduced earlier) will give an
estimate of the critical path in a system by searching all paths
between clocked registers and finding the slowest.  This then sets the
&lsquo;standard&rsquo; for other logic speeds; there is (usually) no
point in optimising any logic paths already faster than the critical
path.
</p>

<p>
The delay of the <b>critical path</b> will depend on the number of serial
logic gates, their type, the fanout and other factors affecting the
electrical load (particularly wire lengths) and their output impedance
or &lsquo;drive strength&rsquo;.  All these factors go into &lsquo;the
mix&rsquo; when attempting to optimise the circuit.
</p>

<p>
Typically, <b>synthesis tools</b> will have <b>options</b> which allow
the engineer to put more importance on speed, size, power etc.  It may
be that a circuit can be optimised for speed but this may result in it
being larger or more power hungry.
</p>

<p>
<b>Edge speeds</b> are the time it takes a digital circuit to switch
between states.  They depend on the outputting gates drive and the
(capacitive) load it needs to switch.  Edges which are &lsquo;too
slow&rsquo; may introduce problems such as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>induced noise near the threshold may be received and amplified.</li>

<li>different target gates may &lsquo;see&rsquo; the input switch at
  (significantly) different times.</li>

<li>increased time spent near the &lsquo;half way&rsquo; level may
  result in an extra power drain.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Tools are available to identify any slow<sup>&dagger;</sup> edges,
possibly for further attention.
</p>

<blockquote style="font-size:80%;">
<sup>&dagger;</sup>The user can define what &ldquo;slow&rdquo; means.
</blockquote>

<p>
The behavioural simulators used for functional verification are not
the only class of circuit simulators.  At the most detailed level are
simulators which model the parameters of each transistor and solve
differential equations: these are typically generically referred to as
&lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE">SPICE</a>
although this is really only one of the families of
software<sup>&dagger;</sup>.  Rather than logic levels these model
analogue voltages.
<p>

<blockquote style="font-size:80%;">
<sup>&dagger;</sup>Like &lsquo;Hoover&rsquo; for &lsquo;vacuum cleaner&rsquo;.
</blockquote>

<p>
The modelling in such precise detail gives very good answers but takes
a lot of computation.  Therefore such modelling is usually confined to
small units such as <i>standard cells</i> (q.v.).
</p>

<p>
There are also simulators which approximate the analogue behaviour
more cheaply (but less accurately).  These can be used to produce good
timing models (especially from post-layout netlists) since they are
modelling the gates' &lsquo;drive&rsquo; and the wires'
&lsquo;load&rsquo;, revealing signal edge speeds etc.  They are still
slower than a simple, digital model for functionality.
</p>

<blockquote style="color:blue">
Note that a potential disadvantage of an analogue simulation is that
the signals are always represented by a voltage: there is no concept
of &lsquo;unknown&rsquo;
(<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">X</span>) values
which can sometimes be useful in fault-finding.
</blockquote>

<p>
With &lsquo;challenging&rsquo; speed targets a flip-flop may be
designed with a data <b>hold time</b> longer than its propagation delay.  With
such it would be dangerous to connect one flip-flop output directly to
another's input.  Any logic in-between will naturally act as an
additional delay and help meet the true constraints.  <b>Hold-time
checking</b> will identify any remaining risks here and allow extra
buffer insertion.
</p>

<p>
Remember that problems with a too-long critical path may be accommodated
by reducing the clock frequency.  Hold-time problems are a property of
the circuit and there is no cure if they appear in the chip!
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Delay lines</h3>

<p>
It <i>is</i> possible &ndash; and sometimes necessary &ndash; to build
delays onto ASICs.  An approximate delay can be produced with a
&lsquo;chain&rsquo; of inverters or buffers; the actual delay on a
given design and process may vary by a factor of two or more depending
on the manufacturing and operation conditions of the chip.
</p>

<p>
Precise delays need to be calibrated against a reliable reference
frequency.  These are typically chains of gates (as above) whose
length can be altered (e.g. by multiplexing output taps) to give the
nearest available approximation to the required delay.  Periodic
recalibration may be needed due to thermal drift.
</p>

<p>
An example would be a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-locked_loop"><b>Delay-Locked
Loop</b></a> (DLL).  For instance Xilinx FPGAs contain a small number
of DLLs which allow the insertion of a known delay.  A typical
application is to delay a clock signal so that edges at the leaves of
the distribution tree are in phase (via a <i>total</i> delay of a
number of clock cycles) with an incoming reference.  This effectively
&lsquo;removes&rsquo; the clock buffer delays.
</p>

<p>
Delays are often needed in <b>communication</b>, such as between chips.
A common application is in SDRAM interfacing where the RAM's clock is
sourced by the master interface, delayed across the circuit board,
through the RAM and back across the board again.  This means returning
data has a well-defined <b>frequency</b> but an ill-defined <b>phase</b>.
Delays are used to bring received signals bak into phase with the
internal clock.  (The delays also need adjusting dynamically as the
temperature (etc.) varies too.)

<h2>Some random curiousities</h2>

<center>
<div class="inset">
<h3>Asynchronous arbitration</h3>

<p>
It <i>is</i> possible to enter an asynchronous domain (one with some
form of <i>pausible</i> clocking (<span style="color:green">it is possible!</span>) with 100%
reliability using an arbiter or <i>mutual exclusion</i> element.  This
is a cell which determines which of its (usually two) inputs arrived
&lsquo;first&rsquo;.  It achieves reliability by <i>detecting</i>
metastability and <i>delaying its decision</i> until this is resolved.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the time taken to make a decision is unbounded so this
process could always take more than a clock period &ndash; however
long that is.
</p>

<div class="inset">

<h3>Chip variation</h3>

<p>
Gate speed depends on various manufacturing and operation conditions,
normally referred to as &lsquo;PVT&rsquo; for Process, Voltage, Temperature.
</p>

<ul style="text-align:left">
<li>Process: variation in manufacturing such as transistor doping density.</li>

<li>Voltage: the supply voltage at a gate will be less than that at
the chip's pins (Ohm's Law); this varies across the chip and may
fluctuate due to other power demands elsewhere.</li>

<li>Temperature: hotter is slower.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center>
<div class="inset">

<h3>Frequency and power</h3>

<p>
The majority of the power dissipation in CMOS logic is dynamic; it
occurs when gates/wires switch.  Thus &ndash; when executing &ndash;
the power dissipation is roughly proportional to the clock
frequency.  Reducing the frequency saves power (dissipates less heat).<br>
