<p style="color:green">This is a little bonus page which outlines the
basis upon which CAD functional simulators are typically built.
Hopefully it illustrates why time has an &lsquo;extra dimension&rsquo;
and explains why sometimes (when there's a particular class of error)
your tests can get stuck in a &lsquo;combinatorial loop&rsquo; where
(visible) <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',

<h1>Event-driven simulation</h1>

<p>
Understanding the <i>principle</i> of an event driven simulation can
illuminate some problems which can occur and be a useful illustration
of a few general programming mechanisms.  Like many such problems a
good starting point is the data structure.  A <i>possible</i>
structure of the <b>event queue</b> is given below: whilst individual
implementations may vary &ndash; and some details are omitted here
&ndash; hopefully this will illustrate the principle.<br>
Any particular tool will have its own way to do this but the order of
operations is the same.
</p>

<center>
<img src="figures/event_queue.png" alt="Event queuing logical structure">
</center>

<p>
This structure starts with a <font style="color:red;"><b>linked list</b></font>
(left, in red) which contains elements for each time at which one or
more things are scheduled to happen.  Each entry has a list
(or <i>two</i> in this figure) of things that happen at that time.
For example, in a Verilog simulation this might begin with
a <font style="color:red;">single entry at time&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</font>
with a list of all the <font style="font-family: 'Courier New',
monospace;">initial</font> statements/blocks.  These are <b>lists</b>
since the number of events contained will vary.
</p>

<p>
The figure shows <i>separate</i> lists for
<font style="color:green;">blocking</font> and
<font style="color:blue;">non-blocking</font> assignments; both of
these will be &lsquo;executed&rsquo; completely at the appropriate
time, <i>blocking assignments first</i>.
</p>

<p>
If the time of the next event(s) in the list are in the future, the
simulation time is advanced to this point; the lists are then
processed.  Pragmatically, it is likely that elements from the list
will be dealt with in the list order but the order of items is
arbitrary; however statements <i>in a given block</i> will be
processed in the order in which they are written.
As a block is processed it is likely that some output changes will
produce more events, either instantaneously (in simulation time) or at
some future time; these must be <b>added</b> in the appropriate places,
appending to a list or creating a new list as required.
<font style="color:green;">This may include adding entries to the list
  currently being processed.</font>
</p>

<p>
When all the blocking assignments are complete any non-blocking
assignments are processed in a similar way.
<font style="color:blue;">Note the sequencing!</font>  However the
outputs are not committed at this point, just stored temporarily; thus
any changes here, even at the same simulation time, will not affect
other, &lsquo;simultaneous&rsquo; statements.
<font style="color:blue;">The statement <i>order</i> is therefore
irrelevant.</font>  When this list is completed it can be reprocessed
to commit the output state changes; these changes might happen at the
current (simulation) time or later, by scheduling future events.
</p>

<p>
At this point all the events at this time have been processed.
Assuming that the event queue is not empty, simulation <b>time can now
advance</b> to the point where more actions are scheduled.
</p>

<h2>A problem case</h2>

<p>
If there is a logic &lsquo;loop&rsquo; where no time elapses the
simulator will not be able to progress in time and will (apparently)
stall.  Here is a simple example:
</p>

<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
always @ (a, b)<br>
begin<br>
b = a;<br>
a = !b;<br>
end<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, after running the block both <font style="font-family: 'Courier New',
monospace;">a</font> and <font style="font-family: 'Courier New',
monospace;">b</font> have changed, creating <i>new</i> events which
will cause the block to run again &hellip; ad infinitum.<br>
Time can never advance. &#128542;
</p>

<p>
Most such examples which occur in development will be more obscure
&ndash; and can happen quite easily when not using clocked registers
enough.  They are usually a case of trying to do too much in a single
clock cycle, often with signals linking different modules.<br>  If
such a problem appears likely, a <i>bug-finding</i>
technique<sup>&dagger;</sup> can be inserting a small delay:
</p>

<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
always @ (a, b)<br>
begin<br>
b = a;<br>
<font style="color:red;">#1</font> a = !b;<br>
end<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
This allows time to continue and, if there is a problem, (rather
frantic) oscillation of the signals will become apparent.
</p>

<blockquote style="font-size:80%;">
<sup>&dagger;</sup>Not a permanent solution.  There needs to be a
state-holding element somewhere in the loop.
</blockquote>
