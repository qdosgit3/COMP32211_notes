<h2>Functional simulation</h2>

<p>
This depicts a typical RTL development flow.  Source code is developed
(possibly also as <i>schematic</i> diagrams although this is currently
decreasing in popularity), then processed and simulated with some form
of testbench/stimulus.  The output can typically be viewed as traces
with (selected) signals vs. time and potential problems can (perhaps)
be spotted.  Additionally the simulator may produce output which can
be compared with expected <i>independently generated</i> results,
either by the testbench or using some external application.<br>
Feedback is used to correct the design, sometimes also the testbench
and even (occasionally) the expectation if an earlier mistake has
escaped notice<sup>&dagger;</sup>.

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>
To verify that the RTL description fulfils all the logical operations
required of the system.
</p>

<p>
You develop (a piece of) a system.  It has to perform a certain set of
functions and fit the appropriate set of interfaces.  To do this a set
of tests are required.
</p>

<div class="row">

  <div class="column">

<p>
Some tests may already exist:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Example: checks that a bus interface obeys the prescribed
      protocol.  When a module is complete and tested it can be used
      in higher level functional tests.
</ul>

<p>
You provide:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a design, comprising HDL modules, schematics etc.
  <li>a stimulus sequence to stress the design
  <li>(possibly) a set of expected results
  <ul>
    <li>maybe generated from a higher level model
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
You can collect:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>waveform traces of a set of signals
  <li>internal states at various times/conditions
</ul>

  </div>

  <div class="column">

<h4>What you <i>don't</i> get (yet)</h4>

<ul>
<li>Proof that your logic is synthesizeable
  <ul>
  <li>on the target technology &mdash; or, indeed, at all!
  </ul>
<li>Estimates of size
  <ul>
  <li>feasibility
  <li>economic viability
  </ul>
<li>Estimates of speed
  <ul>
  <li>cycle accuracy is provided for synchronous units
  <li>no estimates of critical path &Rightarrow; cycle time
  </ul>
<li>Estimates of power requirements
</ul>

  </div>
</div>

<p>
If any of the above criteria fail later then the RTL will need
redesigning.
</p>

<p>
Any editing may change (break) the functionality, so retesting
(&lsquo;regression&rsquo;) is important.
</p>

<p>
Intention: reduce the number of redesign cycles to a minimum.
Experience helps with this &ndash; but is not a sure guide.
</p>

<blockquote style="font-size:80%;">
<sup>&dagger;</sup>Shouldn't happen but we're all human.
</blockquote>

<h3>Practice</h3>

<p>
Objective is to verify the <b>logic</b> behaviour of the design.<br>
Try to exercise every function.
</p>

Can be assisted by <b>test-coverage tools</b>:
<ul>
<li>Which HDL statements have (not) been executed
<li>Which branches have (not) been taken
<li>Which nodes have (not) adopted both binary states at least once
  <ul>
  <li>at behavioural HDL there are no &lsquo;nodes&rsquo; so this is tricky!
  </ul>
</ul>

Achieving &lsquo;complete&rsquo; coverage can be quite challenging!

It is not possible to gain accurate <b>timing</b> models ...  yet.

<ul>
<li><b>Cycle accuracy</b> is inherent &ndash; can count clock pulses
  <ul>
  <li>may previously have been estimated
  </ul>
<li>Some <b>annotation</b> is possible with estimated delays
</ul>

<div class="row">

  <div class="column">

<h4>What it does</h4>

<p>
Functional simulation &ndash; which you should be familiar with
&ndash; is a test of the logic operation of a design.  Higher level
models should have shown that the algorithm can work; now the
implementation must be verified.
<p>

<p>
Functional simulation is (primarily) a digital, event-driven
simulation.  This allows the simulators to run quite quickly which, in
turn, allows a lot of test patterns to be exercised in a sensible
elapsed time.
<p>

<p>
Simulation (of a synchronous design) at this level will be cycle
accurate so the number of clock pulses taken can be counted.  This
gives a better &lsquo;feel&rsquo; for the timing of a function.  This may allow
some redundant cycles to be identified and eliminated.  If the design
has a constrained clock speed then accurate performance estimates are
possible, assuming the target clock speed can be achieved.
<p>

  </div>

  <div class="column">

<h4>What it doesn't do</h4>

<p>
What this form of simulation doesn't give directly is any assurance
that a particular clock frequency can be achieved by the synthesized
logic.  Delays can be included in the simulation but, in the first
instance, these are simple estimates.  Later, when the design has been
developed further, more realistic delays can be <b>extracted</b> from
the synthesized circuit and <b>back-annotated</b> to improve the
realism of the simulation.
<p>

<p>
However, typically, a few test patterns are able to show timing
problems.  The main value of functional simulation is to provide good
test coverage of the logical design.
<p>

   <h3>Hint</h3>
<p>
To avoid the simulation &lsquo;running away&rsquo;, a statement like:
</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; initial #10000 $stop;</p>

<p>can halt a simulation after a time limit.</p>

<h3>Functional Simulation in Verilog</h3>

Verilog is a Hardware Description Language.

<ul>
<li>It can do things that are not (easily) made into actual hardware.
<li>This is useful for test purposes.
<li>The test environment can respond to state evolution of the Device
  Under Test
<ul>
<li>...  without writing an explicit machine
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Example: a handshake signal:</p>

<center>
<img src="figures/functional_simulation.png" alt="Unit test environment">
</center>

<ul>
<li>The <font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">req</font>
signal may be timed by reacting to the state of <font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">ack</font>.<br>
</ul>

<center>
<p style="color:red;">
(Note: the protocol shown here is not quite the same as used in the lab.)
</p>
</center>


<h3>Test strategy</h3>

<p>
The test block needs to provide
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">req</font>&rsquo;
which interacts with
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">ack</font>&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
One way: work out in advance (by hand?) the expected response times of the
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">ack</font>&rsquo;
signal and drive
&lsquo;<font style="font-family:'Courier New',monospace;">req</font>&rsquo;
accordingly.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Should expose the first error
<li>May be unreliable thereafter
</ul>

<p>
Another way &mdash; use the language to respond to the test block.
</p>

<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
&hellip;<br>
while (ack == 1) @ (posedge clk);   // AAA<br>
req <= 1;<br>
while (ack == 0) @ (posedge clk);   // BBB<br>
req <= 0;<br>
&hellip;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
This:
<ul>
<li>tests to see if any previous handshake is complete (AAA)<br>
if not, wait for a clock cycle and test again
<li>asserts the request
<li>inserts clock cycles until the acknowledge rises (BBB)
<li>removes the request
<li>continues &ndash; the test for handshake completion would occur before
req is raised next time.
</ul>

This form of test would typically be a single &lsquo;thread&rsquo;
which would run in parallel with other statements.
</p>

<p>
The details of such a handshake can be &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; in
a <b>task</b>.
</p>

<h4>Example: FIFO test</h4>

<img src="figures/FIFO.png" alt="FIFO" align="right" width=40%>

<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
initial &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Input handshake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;req_in <= 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;@ (posedge clk);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;req_in <= 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;while (ack_in == 0) @ (posedge clk);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;req_in <= 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;while (ack_in == 1) @ (posedge clk);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat (10) @ (posedge clk); &nbsp; // Pause before continuing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
&nbsp;<br>
initial &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Output handshake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ack_out <= 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;while (req_out == 0) @ (posedge clk);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat (2) @ (posedge clk); &nbsp; &nbsp;// Choose to
		   insert extra delay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ack_out <= 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;while (req_out == 1) @ (posedge clk);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ack_out <= 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is an illustrative example.  A real test would continue, for
example stalling in different phases, trying to overfill the FIFO etc.
There would probably be some data carried through (and tested for
correctness) too!<br>
A good verification test will subject the Device Under Test to
examples of any situation it might legitimately experience in
operation.
<span style="color:red"><b>Be vicious!  Try and break it!</b></span>
</p>

<p>
Note: it is convenient (but not compulsory) to use independent
blocks (threads) at the input and output.  This allows freedom of
timing so that (for example) if the <i>latency</i> of the FIFO is
changed the test will still work.<br>
In the example above the output acknowledgement has been arbitrarily
delayed; a thorough test might use a range of delays (including none)
&ndash; for example using a random value.

<h3>Handy constructs</h3>

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color:blue;">
<b>if (Boolean_expression) statement_1 {else statement_2}</b>
</p>

<p>
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">if</font>&rsquo;
has several uses:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Synthesized into a multiplexer
<li>Making a run-time decision in simulation
<li>Control in generate of circuits [See later]
<li>Conditional compilation (as <font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">`ifdef</font>, etc.)
</ul>

<p>
It may take an
<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">else</font> clause.<br>

<i>Note: In synthesizable, combinatorial logic the
<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">else</font> may
be wanted to avoid creating a latch, inadvertently.</i>
<p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
repeat (100)<br>
 &nbsp;begin<br>
 &nbsp;@ (posedge clk)<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;if (req) ack <= 1;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;else  &nbsp; &nbsp; ack <= 0;<br>
 &nbsp;end<br>
</blockquote>

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color:blue;">
<b>while (Boolean_expression) statement</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Used for simulation control: e.g.  handshaking
</ul>

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color:blue;">
<b>for (addr = 0; addr &lt; 1024; addr = addr + 1) statement</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Iterate over a number of items: e.g.  memory test
</ul>

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color:blue;">
<b>forever statement</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Loop indefinitely
<ul>
<li><b>must</b> include some <b>delay</b>! &nbsp;
(<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">#</span> or 
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">@</span>)
</ul>
</ul>

<center><div class="inset"> <!-- make narrower -->
   <center><h4>Another strategy</h4></center>
   <div class="left">
   <p>To stop a simulation due to an error, try:</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
   event failed;<br>
   ...<br>
   always @ (failed) #100 $stop;<br>
   ...<br>
   ...<br>
   if (&lt;error condition&gt;) -> failed;<br>
   </p>
   </blockquote>
   <ul>   
   <li>The delay allows time to be able to see the final signal states.
   <li>The error is easy to find &ndash; at the end (in time) of the trace.
   </ul>

<h3>Loop statements</h3>

<p>
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New',

		    much as you would expect.  It is not synthesizeable.

</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
Request is asserted and given time to be seen.
</p>

<p>
If there is no acknowledgement, insert another clock cycle (and try again).
</p>

<p>
Continue waiting until the acknowledgement appears.
</p>

<p>
Probably go and do something else for a while.
</p>

<p>
(Before next handshake) test if acknowledgement removed and wait until
it is.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><b>repeat ()</b></font>&rsquo;
is a simple loop which iterates the following statement a number of times.
</p>

<p>
&lsquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><b>for</b></font>&rsquo;
has C-like function and syntax although the
&ldquo;<font style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">i++</font>&rdquo;
syntax is not implemented in basic Verilog.<br>
