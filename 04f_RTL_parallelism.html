<h2>RTL parallelism</h1>

The two C language loops below (Bresenham) are functionally identical
but formatted differently.

  <p>
  &nbsp;<br>
  The intention is to highlight the scope<br>
  for parallel implementation.
  </p>
  </center>
  </div>

</div clear="both">

<ul>
<li> The LH example is expressed serially &ndash; appropriate for a
  microprocessor with one ALU.
  <ul>
  <li> Neglecting the comparisons (and &lsquo;branches&rsquo;) this
  takes 4 or 6 cycles
  </ul>
<li> The RH example is formatted to show how it could be executed on a
  superscalar CPU.
  <ul>
  <li> This takes 2 or 3 cycles assuming (at least) three ALUs
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Code style</h3>
<p>
The right-hand column shows a C language implementation of a line
algorithm.  This can be divided into quite a long preamble and an
iterative loop which moves the address and plots each point.
<br>
Note:
</p>

<ul>
<li> For a line of significant size, most of the activity will be in the loop
  <ul>
  <li> This is the place where optimizations pay off
  </ul>
<li> The code has been structured so that the output is the address
  <ul>
  <li> This saves plotting points with the implicit multiplication
       each cycle
  </ul>
<li> The loop body has been written in a slightly obscure fashion
  <ul>
  <li> This is to &lsquo;remove&rsquo; asymmetry in the control
  structure
  </ul>
</ul>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">

  <p>
  Let's look at some &lsquo;simpler code&rsquo;.  (This example is
  restricted to a particular octant but that is not relevant for the
  moment.)
  </p>

  <p>
  Executing one line/clock a loop would take 6 or 8 cycles.
  </p>

<ul>
  <li> Some parallelism is apparent
    <ul>
    <li> e.g.  the counter operation
       (<span style="font-family: 'Courier New',
       monospace;">c--</span>) is independent of other functions.
    </ul>
  <li> There are dependencies.
    <ul>
    <li> e.g. the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',
       monospace;">if</span> depends on a previous operation
       and a test.
    </ul>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="column">
  <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
  while (c > 0)<br>
  &nbsp; {<br>
  &nbsp; x = x + 1;<br>
  &nbsp; e = e + 2*dy;<br>
  &nbsp; if (e > 0)<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; y = y + 1;<br>

  &nbsp; c--;<br>
  &nbsp; plot(x, y, col);<br>
  &nbsp; }<br>
  </p>
  </div>
</div clear="both">


<p>
You may spot that the tests (<span style="font-family: 'Courier New',
monospace;">while</span>/<span style="font-family: 'Courier New',
monospace;">if</span>) are tests for positive which is already
represented by a single bit; thus they cost &lsquo;nothing&rsquo;.

<h3>Parallel RTL example implementation &hellip; as a schematic</h3>

<img src="figures/Bresenham_parallel.png" alt="Parallel Bresenham
					       datapath" width=100%>

<ul>
<li> Single cycle operation: control is simple
<li> Precalculated increment/decrement values: some setup required
<li> Rapid cycle: critical path is an adder plus a multiplexer
<li> Requires several parallel adders
<li> Some calculations are <b>speculative</b>: wastes power
<li> Plot is <b>pipelined</b>
</ul>

<p>
The figure shows a block diagram of the Bresenham's line algorithm loop
implemented in a highly parallel way.  This is designed for single
cycle operation.
</p>

<ul>
<li> On the left two possible next addresses are calculated: one accounts
for a horizontal or vertical step (as appropriate) the other for a
  diagonal step.
<li> At the same time the central section calculates the
  &lsquo;error&rsquo; both if the &lsquo;if&rsquo; should/should not
  be taken.  The increment registers holds appropriately precalculated
  values.
<li> The result of one of these operations is tested to see if the
  &lsquo;if&rsquo; should be taken.  This is simple because the
  comparison is &lsquo;> 0&rsquo; which is the sign bit in a two's
  complement notation.
<li> The appropriate bit switches the two multiplexers to route the
desired new values to the accumulator registers.
<li> The output address is sent to a subsequent pipeline stage, together
with the pixel data (not shown).
<li> On the right a counter controls the iteration of the whole unit.
</ul>

<p>
This unit is <span style="color:green"><i>fast</i></span>.  There are
two series logic blocks in the cycle but one is a multiplexer (expect
to be two-gates deep) so the critical path is little more than the
adder time.  It is also capable of producing an address on every clock
cycle.  (This may be &lsquo;overkill&rsquo; if the plotting mechanism
cannot keep up!)
</p>

<p>
It is quite <span style="color:red">expensive</span> in hardware
terms: there are four adders and the counter.
</p>

<p>
It is probably not the most power-efficient design because it
employs <i>speculation</i>; it does work that may never be needed,
just in case it is.
</p>

<p>
Single cycle operation means the sequencing control logic is simple:
stop/go.
</p>

<h4>Initialisation</h4>

<p>
The setup is quite complicated.  In this design it was assumed that
this was performed in software by a processor.  This could be done in
parallel, with the next line parameters being calculated and buffered
whilst the current plot is iterating.
</p>

<p>
This is valid reasoning if:
</p>

<ul>
<li> lines are expected to be &lsquo;reasonably&rsquo; long
  <ul>
  <li> a quick estimate suggests 30-40 cycles for the setup;
  </ul>
if lines are very short then this would be the limiting factor
<li> the processor cannot be doing something more useful
<li> the area cost of a hardware preprocessor is &hellip; unpalatable
</ul>

<p>
Another possibility would be to pass simpler parameters (there will
always be some cost in writing to the I/O registers) and perform the
setup locally.
</p>

<ul>
<li> building all the setup logic combinatorially would be quick
(although the critical path would be much longer than our plot loop
so several clock cycles may be needed) but expensive in hardware
  <ul>
  <li> this logic would be idle most of the time
  <li> it may be worth it if you have a big silicon budget
  <li> it's simple to design
  </ul>
<li> devising a small &lsquo;processor&rsquo; to perform the parameter
  transformations
  <ul>
  <li> area efficient
  <li> allows CPU to do other things
  <li> probably fast enough to keep up with parameter loading speed
  <li> needs sequencing/decision control logic
  </ul>
</ul>


<h4>Afterthought</h4>

<p>
Lines come in different lengths.  If these are a mixture of long and
short lengths there may be some benefit in preparing and <b>buffering</b>
more than one set of parameters in advance to try and keep all stages
busy as much as possible.<br>
This forms a <i>pipeline</i> &ndash; at a higher level than just clock
cycles &ndash; and introduces some <b>elasticity</b> into the flow.
</p>

<p>
This <i>may</i> improve overall speed (but by how much?) but would
cost some area and (design, verification) complexity for the
FIFO<sup>&dagger;</sup>.  It is worthwhile in <i>your</i> particular
design?
</p>

<blockquote style="font-size:80%;">

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>
With a synthesizable RTL design it is possible to begin to get some
idea of its feasibility by synthesizing the block and checking the
output statistics.
</p>

<h3>Example: line algorithm</h3>

<p>
Two implementations of the line drawing algorithm are compared
below.  These both use the same iterative machine for plotting pixels,
the difference being that the first includes combinatorial logic to
translate pixel coordinates into the appropriate parameters whereas
the second relies on this being provided by software.
</p>

<p>
Synthesis was for a Xilinx <b>FPGA</b> as used in the lab.  In both
cases no particular optimization has been attempted.
</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Without init.  logic</td><td>100</td><td>93</td><td>117</td><td>91&nbsp;MHz</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p style="text-align:left">
i.e. moving the preparation to software gives a design about half the
size and 14% faster.
</p>

<ul style="text-align:left">
<li> It is easy to generate a lot of logic using a HDL and a synthesizer.
<li> Is it worth it for your application?
</ul>

<h4>Key</h4>

<p>
&lsquo;<b>Slices</b>&rsquo; are the basic logic units on these FPGAs.<br>
Slices contain both D-type <b>flip-flops</b> (F/F) and
logic <b>Look-Up Tables</b> (LUT).<br>
(Combinatorial logic is evaluated using pre-programmed memory tables.)
</p>

<p>
There are other &lsquo;macrocell&rsquo; elements, such as <b>RAM</b>s
and <b>multipliers</b> which may be used by the synthesizer &hellip;
but not here.
