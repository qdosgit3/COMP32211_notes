<h2>Reviewing</h2>

<ul>
<li> People &ndash; <i>even engineers!</i> &ndash; are fallible
<li> Psychologically you tend to see what you expect to see
</ul>

<p>
Reviewing is a process by which others try to find faults in your
work.
</p>

<p>
Useful at various stages of development:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Design review
  <ul>
  <li> have all eventualities been thought of?
  <li> is it more complicated than it needs to be?
  </ul>
<li> Code review
  <ul>
  <li> does this code do what it was meant to?
  </ul>
<li> Test review
  <ul>
  <li> are there cases going untested?
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Reviewing can seem like an informal process.  Unlike, for example, a
compiler's syntax checking it does not guarantee to find every fault
(of a certain class) that may be present.  Nevertheless it can be a
very valuable process.  Being a human process the &lsquo;terms of
reference&rsquo; are not strictly limited and all sorts of things can
turn up.
</p>

<p>
The basic principle is to get other engineers to look at a design
(code etc.) and for them to try and spot things the designer hadn't
thought of.
</p>

<p>
Suggested review process:
</p>

<ul>
<li> The designer(s) invite a small group of colleagues to perform the
  review.  Ideally reviewers should have <i>some</i> background knowledge of
  the project but not be &lsquo;too close&rsquo; to the topic of the
  review.
<li> Designer(s) prepare copies of any background <b>documentation</b> (such
  as code listings and diagrams).
<li> Hold a <b>candid</b> meeting where everyone is prepared to raise issues
  without embarrassment.  Some mistakes may be revealed; some
  &lsquo;dumb&rsquo; questions will be asked; that is okay.
<li> Each designer &lsquo;walks through&rsquo; his/her product <b>in
  detail</b>.  For example, for code this will usually involve looking at
  <b>each statement</b> individually.  Each item should be explained so that
  everyone is clear about its purpose.
<li> Reviewers try to think of cases that are not covered and may
  cause a malfunction.  E.g. &ldquo;What if <u>this</u> value is
  negative?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Did you miss out a &lsquo;default&rsquo;
  here?&rdquo;, etc.
<li> Often, simply the act of trying to present a system to others
  causes the designer to be the first to spot problem cases.
<li> Take <b>notes</b>, so the problems will be remembered.
  Annotating code listings is typically convenient.
<li> Thank the reviewers.
<li> <b>Revise</b> the design according to the suggestions.
<li> <b>Re-review</b>, concentrating on the altered areas.
</ul>

<b>Illustration:</b> a classic fault in C: the sort of thing which is
difficult to spot:
</p>

<blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color:red;">
if (x = 1) &hellip;<sup>&dagger;</sup>
</blockquote>

<ul style="color:blue">
<li> Legal syntax
<li> May do what you expected &hellip;
  <ul>
  <li> &hellip; by chance &hellip;
  <li> &hellip; unless you make a point of testing the case when
       it <i>shouldn't</i> happen
  </ul>
</ul>

<blockquote style="font-size:80%; color:blue">
<span style="color:red;"><sup>&dagger;</sup></span>In case this is
unfamiliar, in C (at least) this is an assignment which will return a
&lsquo;TRUE&rsquo; (non-zero) value so will always do the statement
following.  Some programmers will write &ldquo;<span style="font-family:
'Courier New', monospace;">if&nbsp;(1&nbsp;==&nbspx)&nbsp;&hellip;</span>&rdquo;
instead because this will force a syntax error if mistyped as
&ldquo;<span style="font-family: 'Courier New',
monospace;">if&nbsp;(1&nbsp;=&nbspx)&nbsp;&hellip;</span>&rdquo;.
